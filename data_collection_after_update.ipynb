       " 3971035: 'What did \"the weird kid\" in your school do that you\\'ll never forget? A year or two after The Dark Knight came out, a guy dressed up as the Joker and burned down our school costing over a million euros worth of damage. He sat down and waited for the police to arrive in full Joker makeup and just went with the police. He said teachers were hypocrites who needed to be reminded that they can\\'t treat students that way.\\n\\nHe never went to prison. He served some community service following a psych assessment. He then went on to study something in an art college. Not sure what he\\'s up to these days. He was definitely troubled as a teenager though. He was in the year above me in school. A girl in his year had a sister in my year who I was close to at the time. The girl had a party and the sister was allowed to have 2 friends over as part of the party, and I was one. At that party he got completely out of it on absinthe and ecstacy. They all would have been around 15-16 at this stage. He ripped up the wooden floorboards in the bathroom, and then put a potted plant in the toilet and flushed it so the toilet clogged and overflowed, but it all seeped into the underfloor because the floorboards had been ripped up. They ended up having to redo the bathroom.\\n\\nThen later that night when everyone was leaving, the girl whose party it was had an uncle come over to drive me and the other younger friend home from the party. I saw the Joker running up and down the road wooping, completely out of it kicking the wing mirrors off cars, and throwing bricks at houses. Wasn\\'t even the end of the drama that night. Not far from her house, we came head on with a drunk driver who was driving up the wrong side of the road with no headlights. Thankfully it was around 2am and there was no one else on the road, so my friend\\'s uncle was able to swerve into the cycle lane and avoid them.\\n\\nThere was another guy in Joker\\'s year who I think even hung around with him, he was done as part of an international child porn ring a couple of years ago. There was some kink in the law where because his case was seen in the district court first, the max sentence was a year in jail and 5 years on the sex register. But if the case had been referred to the high court, the max sentence was 5 years and life on the register. So he plead guilty at the district. He was 26 when sentenced. So at 31 it will be like nothing ever happened. He got lenience because he never distributed the images and videos he\\'d received. They seized his hard drives and he was done on possession. But it was FBI and Interpol and all involved.\\n\\nIt\\'s funny to me because our year was touted as one of the worst to come through the school. And we were horrible. But then the year above us had people like that! They did have a really cool MMA fighter guy who\\'s doing really well in Bellator at the moment though, so it wasn\\'t all bad.\\n\\nThen there was a guy a few years below me who tried to get into the Irish army and failed. So he joined the British army. He got kicked out after he used his phone to put Nazi symbols and swastikas on his army uniform and was doing the sieg heil and all. He told a Muslim woman that he was going to drown her in her children\\'s blood. Then he was allowed back into the British army and had a 6 month jail sentence for saying that to the Muslim lady, reduced to a 12 month suspended sentence because he got a character witness from a higher up in the British army.

I find a small family of pacific islanders (i.e. Galapagos) who are visiting Mexico, but, due to travel bans do not have means of getting back home. Again, I show a copious amount of cash and offer to sail them home if they provide homage and internet so I can continue trading options.  \\n\\nAssume, without complications, we arrive at the island by July/August. By that time, I would be a multimillionaire, seeing that I played the initial crash and then road the v-shaped recovery back up. I live out the next month or so maybe working at a little bar or cantina on the island, documenting and reflecting on my journey.\\n\\nBy late September, I have squeezed just about as much as I can out of the markets, so I drop it all in high paying dividend ETFs accruing thousands in interest each month. I split it 5 ways and send four fractions to each of my family members back in the states, each with a thoughtful note on the first payment.\\n\\n2020, if I could go back in time I could be living out the rest of my days on an island in the middle of the pacific ocean. \",\n",

Maybe skip the jeans and sneakers for a dress and heels. I'd love it if she would dance with me too but if she didn't like to dance atleast let me pull her to the dance floor and dance around her. I'd really love it if she loved nature like I do, camping, hiking, fishing, days out on a boat or at the beach.
