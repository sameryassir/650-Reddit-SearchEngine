What's your most controversial opinion?,2476460,1,"I have had multiple. The ones I remember are MLP, Justin Bieber, and hello kitty. Those are ones I‚Äôve since grown out of, and I did so around 7ish years ago when I was like 7/8. Others I still enjoy are things like Pok√©mon/Minecraft, legos, Pok√©mon cards, and art(tbh, art is a bigger thing to me than warriors. I still make fanart for the series, but I don‚Äôt read the books as much. I also do things besides warriors, like Pok√©mon, when I draw)

I do credit the books in getting me more hooked into doing art as a hobby. I‚Äôve pretty much always loved art and been above average at it, but reading the books really stretched my creativity, party because of the unique story of the book (I would get into it, but I don‚Äôt want to write a book explaining the series lol). The book series is something that pretty begs for fanart, mostly because it‚Äôs about cats, and the appearances of them are up to the readers because there is very little official art of the characters, and even then most people don‚Äôt go by the official art, rather creating their own ideas of how the characters look based off of the descriptions in the book. A characters design is virtually guaranteed to vary in some way from person to person(unless the character is a single color, like black or white. But even then, some people (myself included) add a bit of variety to the pattern to add a bit of detail).

There are very few ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù design concepts, but they are minor. One is the character Dovewing, whose eye color was inconsistent across books (there isn‚Äôt a single author, instead it‚Äôs a team of authors that go under the alias of Erin Hunter, aka ‚ÄúThe Erins‚Äù, and this is why there are sometimes inconsistencies). It‚Äôs mostly agreed to be green, but sometimes people may draw her w/blue eyes. And the only other one I know of is with the character Scourge, and the color of his collar, witch has never been described in the books. Most people agree it purple, though.",2,

Other times we might say ""nothing"" because we don't want to talk about it. Perhaps we're mulling over something that upset us, or something related to a controversial topic. We know that if we mention it, it's going to start a conversation we don't want to have. If we know our SO well enough, we know what topics not to bring up if we're not in the mood for a long discussion. So again, we just say ""nothing.""

How do you deal with stress in your life?,2157364,3,"I developed a porn addiction at a very young age that has ruined my life, at 21 years old I still struggle with it.

When I was around 4 or 5 years old I first discovered porn/masturbation and was instantly drawn towards it as it was something that was exciting and could be used at something to relieve stress and as something that could be enjoyed. Since I was never really educated about porn/masturbation/sex I grew up not having a full understanding of what it was and how I played a role in society and when interacting with others as well as being a private person I never felt comfortable being able to discuss anything about this to anyone and have a still never talked about this to anyone in my life. Growing up it was a huge secret and a large part of my life that I never discussed with anyone as I was very uncomfortable talking about anything in my life to anyone. When I was young I was a an outgoing and sociable person but as I hit puberty I became a very socially anxious and depressed person which caused me to prefer to be at home alone where over time porn began to become a much more frequent activity to the point where it became something that was part of my daily routine and something that I was doing multiple times a day not  knowing of the negative effects that it has on a child/young teenager. As I reached high school I had become extremely socially anxious and depressed to the point where I was terrified of being in public or talking to people that were outside of my immediate group of friends. Also around this time porn/masturbation had become such an addiction to the point where I began having a large loss in the overall enjoyment and in the physical sensitivity of my phallic friend. This led to me having trouble with erections and being able to finish which took a huge hit on my confidence and self esteem. When I reached college I was still anxious and depressed so I had never actively pursued a girlfriend in high school so I had never had sex or even kissed a girl. In the first month of living in college residence a girl came to my room and after talking for a while she said that she was attracted to me and she began to kiss me. After a while she started to give me a blowjob but I was unable to feel a single thing, it was as if she wasn't even doing anything and there was not a single chance that I was even going to finish. This led to me awkwardly saying that I couldn't feel anything which made me feel humiliated. After that night I had just thought that the reason I didn't feel anything was because I was very nervous and it was my first time. A couple weeks later a different girl wanted to have sex with me so we did but even then I couldn't feel anything and was unable to really know what I was doing as I had no feeling although luckily I was able to finish after quite a while. But yet again I just summed it up to just being nervous. After that I became close friends with another girl and we became sort of a friends with benefits kinda thing. We would frequently engage in having sex but each time I would barely feel anything which caused me to be worrying if I was even hard or not and would have a hard time finishing and even then it would be weak orgasms. This is where I began to realize that this wasn't from being nervous as me and this girl were very close and I was comfortable with her. Even though we were close I still never told her what I was dealing with. In my second year of college after she had finished her program and moved home I was very depressed as early in the school year of 2nd year I had a falling out two of my closest and oldest friends back home who had taken advantage of a girl(she was a close friend of our friends girlfriend) that I had been talking to and we had become quite into each other but she didn't think it would work with me not being in our hometown that often. After that night I became very depressed and began to have issues trusting others because of that. Since I was going to school in a different city and didn't know anyone and being very depressed I spent nearly all of my time alone in my room where I wasn't taking care of myself. At this point porn had almost completely taken over my life as it was really the only thing that gave me the slightest bit of pleasure in my life. But the frequency in doing over time has caused my nerves to become numb and I hope to God that it is nothing permanent. Near the end of my second year of my program (it was only a 2 year program) I began to read up on pornography and addiction to which I realized that I was very much addicted to it and was realizing how much it can have a negative affect on your mind and body, especially when your young. I am now 21 years old back at home studying engineering and trying to deal with quitting masturbation/porn so that I can potentially have the life that I would have had if I never discovered porn at a young age. With the pandemic going on and having lots of free time to myself I see it as a second chance in life to work on my myself and change who I am for the better. Even to this day I have never told a single person about my struggle with pornograpgy.

All of this has caused me to feel like I will never be able have a relationship or love someone as currently I struggle with being able to perform and am unable to feel any emotional connection or any pleasure during intercoms and during anything else. My whole life I have been very lonely and isolated.",1,
How do you deal with stress in your life?,4348085,3,"I've never had to deal with debt.  


My parents did financially really well for themselves (Dad worked for Microsoft in the 90s when they were giving away cheap stock-options like confetti)

I learned computer science in university which was paid for by my parents, so I had no student loans to pay off.  
I initially got a job as a games developer, then later moved on to apps before becoming a web developer.  
Nowadays I earn solid money doing work I regard as trivially easy. (Everything is easy after working in the games industry)

When I bought my first apartment, my parents again paid for most of it outright, so I didn't have to deal with a mortgage.  
They always regarded it as their duty to ensure I got the very best start in life they could give me, and they had the resources to back it up.  
Not having that debt-millstone around my neck means I've been significantly better off financially myself, I can save significantly more easily because only a fraction of my paycheck is actually needed for bills and utilities.

Starting life with massive debt and loans is painfully commonplace. It's a weight that prevents us from reaching our potential. It stunts the growth of our lives hugely right when it will have the worst impact, and it introduces stress and anxiety to terrible effect.

Debt, particularly student-debt, can literally drive people to suicide.  
I feel I'm enormously lucky to have avoided that *and* managed to get a career-path that pays much better than average.  


It means I can spend relatively freely because I don't have to worry about money month-to-month.   
I can take my fianc√©e on expensive dates from time to time, we can go on destination-holidays, I don't fear being made redundant because I can (and have) built a safety net of savings.  
I am given confidence because I have the money and resources to deal with most things that can realistically happen.  
I live in a fairly nice apartment in a decent part of the suburbs of Manchester, UK.  
I'm engaged to a woman I dearly love and hoping to get married next September.  
I have money for my hobbies and hopes for the future.

I genuinely believed she hated me for most of my life. I moved out and moved to another country for college and our relationship started improving slowly because it was harder for her to blame everything on me when I wasn‚Äôt there. It was also harder for her to cause me unneeded stress and anxiety by claiming every week that we were going to lose everything(fun fact we never were and she knew that). I guess over the last few months before I came home for this past summer, she might have started going to therapy and started reflecting on what she did as a parent. She allowed me to start talking about bits of it and how my therapists have said I was psychologically abused by her because she was unwilling to deal with her own mental issues... and she apologized for it. Do I believe her apology? Not really. I think she just wanted to feel like she was a good parent, since she started doing her old shit again not too much later.

The same comes true for things like finding love, it may be in every high school film ever, but you don't need to fall in love and get laid asap, just relax and do what you want at your own pace.

When did you feel the most scared and why?,722988,2,"I was in southeast Alaska for around 15 days a few summers ago. We had just finished up dinner and washed out our pots and pans and gone to our respective tents in the trees along the shore we had stopped at for the night. The spot we had chosen to camp wasn't ideal. The tide was set to come in pretty far that night and it would only leave us with a few feet before the water would be lapping at our tent flaps. But we also didn't care that much as it had been raining and incredibly windy that day so kayaking was hardly any fun at all and we needed to stop. About 45 minutes after we had said goodnight to one another I heard some splashing in the tidal zone, probably 20 feet from my tent. I didn't think much of it because a few times before when in Alaska we had stopped at beaches where the tide had risen to within a few feet of our tents. Anyway, I try to ignore it, although in my mind I'm freaking the fuck out. Our camp spot was less than ideal if you wanted to escape in the middle of the night. We were at the base of a relatively steep hill that was covered in alders and slick with rain, to the left, probably 70 feet from where we camped there was a rocky outcrop that went out into the water and was about 20 feet tall and steep enough that you couldn't climb it. If, for example, a grizzly bear (and there were a lot out that time of the summer, we had seen 4 or 5 that day alone, patrolling the beaches) wanted to see what was going on down the beach and walked towards us from the right it would basically seal off our movement. Sort of like putting the cork back in the wine bottle, not many places to go. Anyway, after 15 minutes of hearing splashing I start to try to rationalize it enough to go to sleep. But that's when I start hearing something other than splashing. This incredibly high pitched gargling sound breaks through the night's relative quiet. It sounded as though two cats had gotten into a fight but every time they let out a scream the other cat would push the one cats head underwater. This went on for a good twenty minutes. After it died down I hear ""that's weird huh?"" from the other tent, obviously trying to downplay the incident. I, being scared as fuck, just reply ""yep, going to sleep!"" Another 15 minutes pass without much sound, but then the same gargling breaks through the night, this time much much closer. The noises are deeper this time, more guttural. It sounds like an old man fighting with a cat, and each time either of them shriek they are forced underwater, the splashing intensifies and it sounds like it's right outside my tent. I think that the fear of whatever was going on eventually just zapped me of all energy because eventually i fell asleep. I just remember that I didn't move a muscle, and i didn't move for so long that all of my muscles ached after awhile and I could feel my heart beat in my throat all night long. Anyway, we woke up, had breakfast, broke down the tents and got back on the road. Didn't hear it ever again. A few weeks later I did some googling and I'm pretty sure that it was just some sea otters fighting each other in the intertidal zone. But it was scary as fuck. I'll link the youtube audio of the noises if I can find it!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: They were seals fighting, not sea otters, here's the audio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L\_UKEU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L_UKEU) Imagine hearing this as you lie in the cold dark in the middle of nowhere scared that a grizzly might come down the beach and eat you.

TLDR: Lying in the dark in Alaska and hear guttural screams and what sounds like someone being drowned, in the pitch black in the middle of nowhere, 20 feet outside of my tent.",1,

When did you feel the most scared and why?,1322762,2,"me n my older sister went through a phase where we would wake up, get dressed, leave the house, walk around the block until my mom left for work then go back inside and go back to bed or do whatever we wanted. we would get home before her so we didnt have to pretend at the end of the day. this went on for months til the school got a hold of my dad (divorced parents). . . . got threatened to be sent to school in California for bad kids... we stayed and i graduated with honors. 

in middle school my friends and i would sneak into the locker room during gym to BS cause we hated sports. one time i felt daring and we had little cubby lockers. i decided to climb the lockers and sit all the way at the top, these things were about 7ft which is high to my 11yr old self. i felt good. looking down at my friend who turned sheet white and said ""ur bleeding!"" when i looked and saw a puddle on top of the lockers and a huge gash on my elbow. i didnt feel it, but i got scared cause now i would have to tell someone. went out to my gym teacher and made up a bs story about how one of the locker doors closed on my elbow. he believed me and said thats what i get for getting my bag before the period was over but took me to the nurse anyway. i left a trail of blood all the way to the nurse. my parents believe that story too",1,
When did you feel the most scared and why?,2153947,2,"I'm feeling really anxious today. I tried meditating before my GF left for work just to feel good about my day, but what I realized is I don't feel good about my day. I just feel kind of bleh about the fact that I have to work for 2 hours (ONLY 2HRS??) and just kinda feel lonely and aimless. I usually don't feel this way because I have stuff I want to do, like play league or chill and watch twitch.

I do want to chill and watch twitch, but I'm scared of feeling lonely/aimless after finishing work and not having that ""need to work""... in the back of my head. While I procrastinate. Which is how I usually operate. Until my GF is around then it's like chill + hang with her + joke around and have fun.  I guess this is my main issue.

I was feeling FINE yesterday, good even, just relaxing after she left for work. I was really sleepy/tired.

I think the issue is I'm just finally face to face with NO distractions or reasons to not work (tired, not enough sleep, gf's around) and I got scared feeling. Anxious thoughts like ""life is not worth it because working sucks"". Even though doing work isn't really that bad. I guess I just don't feel my job is that important so the ""need"" to do it is... just a selfish one? One that only benefits myself. Like the ""need"" is a need to make money to sustain my own life.

I'm also just tired of over-thinking this shit... that was the whole point of meditating. To FINISH my WORK FIRST. To not DEFAULT to a mindset of procrastination, but to have a clear mind that would say ""hey, let's do our work now so we can relax fully later!"" I guess I also am able to relax before doing my work... OR after my work. So it's like, if I'm weighing the 2 options, my mind calculates that relaxing now is better. Why am I trying so hard to finish my work before relaxing if I can just relax first and work after with no downsides? 

I'm 26 years old, I got another 50 or so odd years... if I'm lucky. Let's make them count... Nothing bad about feeling good, if it doesn't hurt anyone.

I'm terrified about trying to ""help"" people... I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to be happy, for others... only myself... I think I know how to be happy? I'm kinda getting the hang of it, even with work and gf. It's easier with my job because my job is so chill. I really like having a chill job, it gives me so much more time to relax and enjoy life. Maybe that's my advice to people. IDK.

There's also the separate issue of me worrying about my GF. She's been kind of down lately from a stressful and very tiring (physically + mentally) job. She is a new dentist and it's hard on her body. She's been a bit down during off time because she's so tired feeling. There's also not much to do due to Covid which just makes these feelings (for both of us) worse. I also feel a little down due to Covid and not being able to do things out and about.

I really hope we can spend Christmas with my whole family but at this rate I'm not sure we will be able to. I'm a bit scared of the general sort of feeling of a dark and lonely winter, just the 2 of us.

She is amazing and I love her so much, and we have lots of fun spending time together when we aren't working, so by that aspect I'm not as scared. But there's also times where it feels like we haven't done anything fun in forever and we just kind of sit around doing nothing and it feels kind of boring and lame. We have a pretty great friend group, hopefully we can see them often.

I think I like our friends more than her, because they're my friends who became hers after she met me. I guess there's not much to do/say about this, just a little bit of a downer that she doesn't have many friends of her own. Or she has a few, but it's only like 2 or 3, and they aren't a ""friend-group"", they're just individual friendships. So she only ever hangs out 1 on 1. It's just not as fulfilling I feel. She must feel quite lonely, and I believe she does. Again, not much I can really do to help her with this, as much as I might want to... :/",1,
When did you feel the most scared and why?,2563742,2,"Long story ahead!

Is it terrible to admit I have ghosted a lot of people? I normally am very confrontational, especially in work settings where professional boundaries are necessary. However, in my personal life I never really end a friendship because I am too insecure about my choice to walk away. What if I‚Äôm just being a diva or not trying hard enough. I will keep putting more and more into the relationship until I give up and just disappear. 

That being said I had a really bad ghost situation that blew up in my face on my birthday. I had a friend of four years during college. We were originally part of a larger group, but individual drama kept split us up one at a time. This particular friend had a great deal of personal issues that she was dealing with at any given point. Her biggest problems stemmed from her depression and anxiety. At first she befriended me because I was a good listener. I would just quietly listen to whatever issues or drama was going on and not offer any judgment or input. To be honest this rubbed my the wrong way because I always had the urge to try and tackle her issues with her. Talk her off the ledge so to speak. But any attempts to speak during our years of ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù were shut down. It was just a one way line where she complained and I didn‚Äôt speak. Long story short I ended up losing my mother to cancer and I started being the one who needed to do the talking. At first she was willing and even kind. But as my depression deepened into thoughts of suicide (messy business where my mom dying meant I had to raise my two entitled sisters and give up my dreams and goals for a while when my dad was still dealing with the shock of losing his best friend and partner) I started ghosting everyone. I knew it wasn‚Äôt healthy but I really didn‚Äôt want to talk or listen to anyone during those days (I am so thankful for my father and girlfriend coming alongside me putting up with all my walls because they knew I was hiding because I was scared and not because I stopped loving them). This friend however took it personally that I ghosted her. Like the audacity that I would leave her, that I shut her out how dare I. She had tried to support me and I didn‚Äôt take her help it‚Äôs like she wasn‚Äôt my friend (those of you keeping track can see the hypocritical irony in her of all people whining about her contributions to a friendship being shut down). In the moment I would feel guilty and pull myself out of my hole to try and make amends. Go out to meet her and spend time with her even though I didn‚Äôt have time with my sisters and didn‚Äôt want to spend time with her anyways. Things got worse as I started feeling better. I had a new attitude about confronting people. The only people worth my time were the people I could be honest with, my mom who had died my dad who loved me through my depression as he tried to stuff away his own and my girlfriend who didn‚Äôt even know me for a year but still was invested enough to keep coming back to help me get once inch further out of my hole. My mom had died and what I remembered most about her was how I was always free to be honest with her about anything and those were the memories I valued now and if I couldn‚Äôt find that in a friendship than I am just not that kind of friend. Naturally this head on strategy always backfired because I‚Äôd pop my head out and text her after a few weeks, listen to her complain about something or other and offer her some thoughts, even just questions about how she felt and what she thinks the underlying problem was and how she was planning on tackling it. Harsh I can hear some of you say but we are past our under grad and graduate level educations at this point and into our careers how long can you pamper a full grown adult. This all came to a head on my birthday where I again tried to message her and listen to her. The conversation started with her yelling at me for being a terrible friend and not doing enough to invest into our friendship. I gave one last ditch effort to ask her why she was mad and why none of my other friends (all of which I talked to way less during the year after my mother‚Äôs death) and she just blew up at me. How dare I ask her that who was I to pretend I knew what she was doing and not doing. How could I after not visiting her in a few months have the audacity to ask her why she was getting angry. She screamed at my for hours about how I couldn‚Äôt possibly know if she was angry (that kids is called irony). She then tried the guilt tripping maneuver to try and talk me into seeing her in person because I‚Äôm just acting tough behind text and she wanted to hear me tell her to her face that I think she was overreacting. Honestly, it broke a part of me. I did everything for this girl. I befriended her out of pity, I heard years and years of her talk about how her life sucks and never once was allowed to speak, I kept justifying how clingy and creepy she would get with asking me out on dates (even though I wasn‚Äôt single and told her it wasn‚Äôt a date) and flirting with me as just her being overbearing (not a good conversation to have with a girlfriend just FYI guys who want to experiment at home). I put up with her drama and her total disregard for everyone but herself and in the end she chose my birthday, the first birthday I actually spent outside of the house ever since my mom died, and just wanted to guilt trip me into seeing her by talking about how sh*tty of a friend I was to her. In the end I just left her on read. She sent a bunch of voicemails crying over the phone and still yelling at me that I didn‚Äôt know her and that I had no right to pretend we were really friends and I just left it. I didn‚Äôt confront and didn‚Äôt take the last word, I considered it my birthday present for myself to have one less toxic friend in my life from then until I die and that put a smile on my face.",1,
When did you feel the most scared and why?,2622900,2,"Body language is extremely subtle sometimes but it almost telepathically changes the atmosphere in a room. When one person is on edge, it tips the dominoes on every person in the room and spreads like a virus. You can feel when people are unhappy, happy, scared or aroused. It‚Äôs primal and can be picked up in the way people shift their eyes, the way their bend their necks to look behind them, when their breathing speeds up, in their small wringing hand movements. Most people can‚Äôt hide their discomfort, and don‚Äôt really care to hide their pleasure. What one needs to understand is that there is a basic bottom line for human behavior in normal situations and anything rising from that baseline appears in body language if you just observe. Try sitting in the mall on a bench and watching the passerby‚Äôs for an hour or so and you‚Äôll get an idea of what is ordinary and extraordinary among body language.",1,
When did you feel the most scared and why?,2730651,2,"When I was 16, walking home from highschool. I passed by a building where a lot of men were working. one of them approached me and started hitting on me. I just kinda ignored him but he followed me down the whole street trying to talk to me. The terror set in when he tried asking me for my name and where I stay, which of course I didn't answer. he eventually stopped following me and I thought that was the end of that, but nope.

Next day dude is there again and follows me again, at this point I'm scared. He started getting more aggressive and saying things like ""why aren't you talking to me??"" And such. Before he leaves he tells me that he has a ""present, so I better show up"" 

Yeah fuck that. The next day I decide to take another route home to avoid that street. It was almost a two hour walk but I wasn't in the mood to get axe murdered. I started avoiding that street altogether for a few weeks. One day I had to hurry home so I figure I take the shorter route. The dude is there again. He follows me again, more aggressively this time. He screams and demands to know where I was and that ""he loves me"". At this point I'm tired, scared, angry and done with this shit. I just turn around and straight up tell him that he needs to leave me alone, that my parents are cops and that I most certainly do not have any interest in him. Bad move. Guy gets angry starts calling me racist and some other nonsense. He eventually leaves me alone I guess I said my parents are cops haha.

Shortly after I moved schools and never had to see this creep again. As an adult now, the thought of a grown ass adult man following a 16 year old like that still makes me feel icky.",1,

When did you feel the most scared and why?,3208896,2," Good morning, it is the first time I use reddit, sorry if I do something wrong, also use the google translator (I speak Spanish). I hope it is understood as well as possible and can help me 

I have been in a relationship for a few months. 14 days ago my partner is super distant and cutting with me, I feel like I annoy her every time I talk to her and that she avoids me.

I always say good morning to him, I ask him if he slept well, how was his day, how is he, if he plans to do something during the day or if he has already done it, and his answers are: ""yes"". , ""not good"". He is not even interested in knowing how I am, if it weren't for the fact that I bring him up, he wouldn't talk to me and the conversation would end, or there wouldn't even be, it really is One-sided.

I asked him to see each other about 5 times and he rejected them all, he told me that he did not want to, or that he did not feel well.

We haven't seen each other in 18 days, in 12 days it's my birthday and I'm afraid to invite her to come and reject me.

I'm really very sad because I don't feel loved at all, nor do I feel like she wants to be with me, I'm just someone else to ignore.

He also told me that he no longer wanted to tell me that he loved me, that he was not born from him and that made me very sad because he doesn't even say good night to me anymore.

In addition, he posts things on his social networks such as: ""I'm not interested"", ""I still expect something from you"", ""I would like to feel loved at least once"", ""Don't you feel like nobody chooses you?""

I spoke to her about 5 days after all this started, I told her how I felt and asked her if she was angry or if something was wrong between us, she just replied: ""no, don't get your head"" nothing more and she It was, that did not leave me at all calm.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that you may be needing time for her and that is perfect, I don't want her to be with me always, I want her to be free, to have 2000 options and to choose me among all of them because she thinks I'm the best, not because she only has me .

Nor do I want him to tell me ""I love you"" every day if he does not feel it, I prefer him to do it from time to time to say it by saying it, I would also like him to show me with actions, I do not want gifts or anything, just something: ""good morning how are you?"" it would be more than enough.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that it has been like that for 18 days and I can't take it anymore, I don't want to leave her either, I really love her, but it doesn't seem to be reciprocated. A ratio is 50/50 and I feel like only I am trying to make it work

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's my fault and I'm not showing her that I love her or she doesn't feel that way, but I have no other way than to worry about her like I do and say nice things to her over the phone or text. I can't go to her house if she doesn't want to see me, I can't help her if she doesn't want to tell me, I can't do anything.

Sometimes I'm scared to talk to her, because I feel like she doesn't want me to. But at the same time I think she may be going through a very bad time and I want her to feel accompanied, I don't want her to feel that I'm not interested, that's why I talk to her and offer to see us. , she helps, but always rejects me or does not respond to me or treats me badly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired, it's been 18 days like this, I'm being patient and I hope it's just a bad time and everything is fine one day, but I don't know, I can't stop thinking about it and crying. I'd like to talk about it but I don't want her to feel like I'm ""attacking"" her, she doesn't have to explain anything to me I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that sadly I am waiting for him to leave me, because I do not see another future for this, if for my birthday we do not see each other or he rejects me to see us or the situation simply continues, I will end everything, it would have been more than month, I don't want him to speak well to me if he feels bad, I don't want him to pretend, but I don't see it as an excuse to mistreat me and make me feel hated and unloved.

What's the funniest joke you know by heart?,4491065,2,"This happened an hour ago, and I‚Äôm still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....  
There‚Äôs 2 ‚Äúsituations‚Äù that leads to the conclusion of the FU.  
First situation:  

Asked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to. 
Found out the memory card still had content.  
Her husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 ‚Äúporn‚Äù video, assuming sent to him a while back.    I‚Äôve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.  
A certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.  
So finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I‚Äôve always fantasized about, ‚Äúgifting my past self‚Äù, while living my happy current life.  

Second accident:  
I have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.  

Wife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it‚Äôs useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she‚Äôs at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.  
 Last night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?  
I have the day off today, today was the day I‚Äôd do the ‚Äúdeed‚Äù. I don‚Äôt only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience. 
This would have lasted me tops 5 mins.    
But the ‚Äúforeplay‚Äù she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.  
Wife‚Äôs phone didn‚Äôt give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.  
She comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.  
She knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.  
But VR porn was never ‚Äúdiscussed‚Äù as an ‚Äúis it cheating if....‚Äù thing. You know the convo I‚Äôm talking about, ‚Äúis it cheating if you have a sex doll‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if it‚Äôs a robot‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time‚Äù, etc...  
It was the type of convo we‚Äôd have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let‚Äôs say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we‚Äôre on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.  
Anyways, VR wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúthing‚Äù back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù for me to do so. I guess it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That‚Äôs when I see her in the room.  
‚ÄúThe fuck??‚Äù she says.   
Then she looks inside.  
‚ÄúIs that my sister?!?!‚Äù   
I‚Äôm fucked.  
She still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.  
Seeing from the tracking app... she‚Äôs at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.  
I‚Äôm fucked.  

TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law‚Äôs 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen

Found the edit 
 UPDATE: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that‚Äôs when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it‚Äôs called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.  
I was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.  
So basically... after posting... after feeling a ‚Äúbit‚Äù better by ‚Äútelling someone‚Äù and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...  
This went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn‚Äôt focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying ‚ÄúCall me‚Äù. I left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn‚Äôt help as I didn‚Äôt focus once on Detective Pikachu.   I received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....  
On the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me ‚Äúfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it‚Äù   
Arrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....  I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch. 
I didn‚Äôt say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù but there was nothing to be ‚Äúsorry‚Äù about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I‚Äôm not for confrontations or leading conversations, I‚Äôm very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù.... but didn‚Äôt know how.  Wife then says ‚ÄúI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.‚Äù  
Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says ‚Äúknows what?‚Äù  
She says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lie, the video‚Äù.  
I was red flushed I‚Äôm sure. My heart was beating so fast.  Then wife said she has deleted the video.  
This is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....  Then sister-in-law speaks... she says ‚Äúyou do understand this video wasn‚Äôt for you‚Äù, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.   
But then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn‚Äôt for her husband neither. He‚Äôs been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he‚Äôs been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it‚Äôs not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.  Sister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates ‚Äúfor now‚Äù. The divorce word can never go out, but she‚Äôs found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.  It was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she‚Äôs been sleeping more and more at her parents house.  Me obtaining the video didn‚Äôt come up more than once. I don‚Äôt know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I‚Äôll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.    
For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.   We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.  Wife seemed ok for now too.",1,
What's the funniest joke you know by heart?,5868137,2,"Aahh, it really comes down to religious practice. According to the Torah, there's very little a husband &amp; wife can't do to each other &amp; there's allot of freedom, **within marriage.** 

That's really the main difference. Fornication/ sex before marriage, or adultery/ sex with anyone other than your spouse is prohibited, along with any form of incest, beastiality, &amp; homosexuality.

Oddly enough, there's no explicit law on the Bible/ Torah against masturbation, other than a story about two sons of Judah, son of Jacob/ Israel, who both were punished to death by G-d for *""spilling their seed on the ground""* instead of climaxing in their wife, so that she'd be able to have children (they were deliberately not impregnating their wife). 

The Rabbis &amp; Sages say that the only issue G-d had with them wasn't masturbating, but that they were doing that &amp; purposefully not procreating with their wife, for selfish &amp; evil reasons which I won't get into here.

EDIT: to add that, the main issue with masturbation is of a spiritual nature, namely, impure thoughts, for example, as in the case of looking at porn, lusting after the image of a woman, which essentially is modern idolatry, tho even in ancient times, many idols were formed to imitate the naked female body, for the same purpose; men worshipped the female image. ""Nothing new under the sun...""

It also states in Torah that a man becomes unclean during ejaculation, but a woman only becomes unclean if his ejaculate touches her, or from the blood of her time of the month. Female ejaculate doesn't contain semen &amp; this of a woman climaxes, she's not ritually unclean.

Keep in mind, being clean/ unclean usually meant not being able to enter the temple in Jerusalem, where the presence of G-d manifested &amp; where the holy place, &amp; the Holy of Holies, were, a scared place.

Keep in mind, being unclean didn't mean you were evil or anything, just meant you couldn't enter the temple &amp; should bathe, visit the temple in Jerusalem &amp; offer a sacrifice to atone for the uncleanness. The atonement for the uncleanness was required out of respect for G-d's presence.

Even regular sex with the wife meant both became technically unclean, specifically if the man ejaculated. Thus, bathing/ purification &amp;, in modern times, since animal sacrifice isn't possible/ practical, prayer after purification, was a must/ became standard practice, &amp; while that may seem droll, many married couples made it an intimate practice that brought them together.

Also, period sex was prohibited; you had to wait till after to even touch her, as her husband. This meant, until menopause, sex was off limits for at least a week out of each month. The wife would then have a ritual bath in an all female bathhouse, &amp; usually, after prayer, would have a romantic evening with her hubby &amp; proceed to bang him till she couldn't move. I joke, but sex is a very celebrated activity in the Torah &amp; in Jewish life, all jokes aside, there's just some things the Law of G-d forbids. Even anal sex &amp; oral sex is fine, role playing (to an extent), BDSM, even CNC. Jewish law &amp; family culture are big on having many children as you can. I know that sounds disturbing to people, but married adults are expected to be responsible. Also, no contraceptives allowed, just about; particularly condoms, or anything that would keep semen from entering the woman's body. This rule isn't too concrete &amp; not really enforced explicitly in the Torah, except for the fact that the first command G-d ever gave mankind was **""Be fruitful &amp; multiply!""** 

Abstanence till marriage is the hardest one for me right now, both me &amp; my fiancee, but we're almost there. Another tough one came from G-d directly, namely Yeshua, the one called Jesus: **""if you even look at a woman for the sake of lusting after her, you've already committed adultery with her in your heart.""** This he said to married men who were apparently perving on other women. This is also another one I struggle with, but I'm doing much much better.

EDIT 2: This is a big one I forgot earlier. Basically, according to Torah, G-d has elected the man to be the head of the house, yes, but as the head G-d commands us thru Rabbi Sha'ul, called Paul; **""Husbands, love your wives, even as Messiah loved [his followers], in that he gave his life [to preserve theirs].""** In other words, the head is responsible for keeping the body happy! This is further highlighted in the Torah regarding the three basic rights of a married woman, three things the Rabbis &amp; Sages agreed a man is obligated to provide for his wife, as much as she wants, without holding back. Those three things include **1) covering.** Essentially this regards clothing, but also can include a house/ living quarters, which, like clothing, covers her nakedness, &amp; also is essentially a permanent covering. **2) food;** of course, within reason, not to excuse overindulgence; another basic necessity. **3) marital rights, AKA: SEXUAL FULFILLMENT!!** The husband is responsible to give his wife **good** sex, as often as she needs it. One may consider that even male &amp; female anatomy gives insight into this understanding. The glans clitoris, compared to the penis, is typically vastly smaller yet has exponentially more nerve endings &amp; is thus much more sensitive &amp; gives women a higher threshold for sexual pleasure. What's more, the penis has multiple functions; urinating, &amp; impregnating. The clitoris? It serves only one purpose; **intense sexual pleasure.** That's why G-d gave it to women; makes up for the pain of child labor... Kinda?? 

Don't get it twisted either; even tho the man must provide sexual fulfillment for his wife, also the wife should lovingly seek to take care of her husband, as if right &amp; fair. It's just that, as G-d dictates at least, the woman **typically** has a greater need for emotional, physical &amp; mental sexual fulfillment.

Also, Rabbi Sha'ul writes to the Jewish woman; **""wives, respect your husbands, just as you respect the L-rd.""** If the husband is a loving, passionate &amp; caring husband, I'm sure she'll have no problem respecting him.

Anyway, hope I helped.",1,
What's the funniest joke you know by heart?,7932331,2,"I can relate strongly to the first one there. I find I have such a fascination with the existential and the substantial at the heart of every matter and so my concerns and questions about life are about philosophy, religion, art, beauty, meaning. I don't care about pop culture, I don't keep up with what is no Netflix or have any suction with the fact that it is a holiday. It is isolating to know that I look at the world with a different set of values and priorities than most of the people I'll be around all the time. 

But, I'm sad all the time because I was abused as a child, I think that there is always a hope in looking at what is meaningful that I'll find a way to feel better about those things too. I don't mind being sad all the time though. There are lots of great reasons to be sad and sadness has its own joys. Staring at your own suffering makes it easier to come to an empathy for everyone suffering and in that way, though I mind that there is a lot of hate and apathy everywhere, I find that I am in the company of everyone. A heart that bleeds can bleed for everyone and so I take my sadness and I wish the whole of everyone well. 

I do not believe we fade into an infinite nothingness. If life can be cruel enough to bring us into being, it can be cruel enough to bring us back into being. Haha, that is less a joke than I make it sounds. I tell my wife that life is too bullshit to just be once, they make you live it a thousand more times around the wheel.

What's a movie or TV show that made you cry?,1690009,3,"I knew a kid from elementary through high school. Nice enough kid, but he seemed to lack common sense on a level that I still haven‚Äôt seen matched. To top it off, he had very poor logic when trying to figure something out that he didn‚Äôt understand, but often would argue with others who tried to explain what he was questioning.

Hard to put one story to sum it up well, but as a couple examples, he once asked me why he could do a push-up, but couldn‚Äôt do a pull up.
After explaining that while doing a pull-up, he was lifting all of his body weight with just his arms, but doing a push-up he only had to push against some of his body weight, because his feet were in the ground and his legs were supporting some percentage of the weight. He just said that wasn‚Äôt correct and that it made sense that they should be the same thing (even though he had already figured out that they weren‚Äôt as he could only do push-ups and not pull-ups).

Everyone does dumb stuff every once in awhile, but it just seemed like he was always doing something dumb. Cooking up food in the microwave and he would put the medal fork in with the food, causing the microwave to spark and freak out. 
10 minutes later he bet someone $20 bucks that he could run 30 miles an hour cause he was confident that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal (he obviously lost the bet).
The next day he was lighting fire crackers and pouring lighter fluid on the ground. When the lighter fluid lit up more than he was expecting, he tried to rush to find something to put the fire out, he reached for the nearest liquid, which was the lighter fluid and started to squirt it into the flames (surprised the guy didn‚Äôt lose a hand), after it was all put out, he looked over at everyone else and said ‚ÄúI forgot that it was lighter fluid and thought it was water, so I could put it out‚Äù.
Even when we were teenagers, it was like he was experiencing everything for the first time and didn‚Äôt know what to expect and often shocked if things didn‚Äôt turn out how he thought they would, even when it was obviously things.

What's a movie or TV show that made you cry?,3952087,3,"It has a certain reputation and some people don't really look past weebs being weebs and glorifying japan (when really it's just a small part of their culture). Or they only think of it as ""big tiddie anime girl"" and think that's the only reason to watch. But Yu Yu Hakusho was also on american TV in the 90's, same as dragonball Z, but DBZ caught on way harder. 

Ultimately anime as a whole is just a very broad media. There are thousands upon thousands of shows, some of them are such ridiculous concepts that would never fly in any other context. Like Assassination Classroom is about this super-species alien that one day blows up 70% of the moon and then announces he will destroy earth in one year. After all the nations of the world try to kill him with missles and fighter jets and things, he requests that he wants to train a classroom of middle schooler misfits to be world-class assassins and to kill him. And it is so genuinely funny and sweet and you really root for the kids to kill him. And he's rooting for it to happen to! 

I'd also recommend Hunter X Hunter as maybe the first show to watch. I can't help but see that as just the best piece of fiction written that I have engaged with in my life. The character development, mood, plot, animation, etc is just unparalleled. There were parts that I was on the edge of my seat so stressed just hoping for someone to win a battle or to overcome an obstacle. Absolutely fantastic show, written by the same guy who made Yu Yu Hakusho, but it's a bit more current style of anime (was released in 2011 as opposed to the early 90s).

And yeah it sounds stupid but most western TV really bores me. Most shows seem to drag things out in a way that only keep you placated to watch the next episode, without going anywhere or if they do it takes them a whole season to get there. Obviously there are exceptions, Fargo is one of my favorite shows, I liked stranger things, The Sopranos is one of the best shows ever written.

There‚Äôs 2 ‚Äúsituations‚Äù that leads to the conclusion of the FU.  
First situation:  

Asked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to. 
Found out the memory card still had content.  
Her husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 ‚Äúporn‚Äù video, assuming sent to him a while back.    I‚Äôve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.  
A certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.  
So finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I‚Äôve always fantasized about, ‚Äúgifting my past self‚Äù, while living my happy current life.  

Second accident:  
I have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.  

Wife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it‚Äôs useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she‚Äôs at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.  
 Last night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?  
I have the day off today, today was the day I‚Äôd do the ‚Äúdeed‚Äù. I don‚Äôt only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience. 
This would have lasted me tops 5 mins.    
But the ‚Äúforeplay‚Äù she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.  
Wife‚Äôs phone didn‚Äôt give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.  
She comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.  
She knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.  
But VR porn was never ‚Äúdiscussed‚Äù as an ‚Äúis it cheating if....‚Äù thing. You know the convo I‚Äôm talking about, ‚Äúis it cheating if you have a sex doll‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if it‚Äôs a robot‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time‚Äù, etc...  
It was the type of convo we‚Äôd have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let‚Äôs say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we‚Äôre on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.  
Anyways, VR wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúthing‚Äù back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù for me to do so. I guess it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That‚Äôs when I see her in the room.  
‚ÄúThe fuck??‚Äù she says.   
Then she looks inside.  
‚ÄúIs that my sister?!?!‚Äù   
I‚Äôm fucked.  
She still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.  
Seeing from the tracking app... she‚Äôs at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.  
I‚Äôm fucked.  

TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law‚Äôs 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen

Found the edit 
 UPDATE: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that‚Äôs when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it‚Äôs called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.  
I was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.  
So basically... after posting... after feeling a ‚Äúbit‚Äù better by ‚Äútelling someone‚Äù and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...  
This went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn‚Äôt focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying ‚ÄúCall me‚Äù. I left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn‚Äôt help as I didn‚Äôt focus once on Detective Pikachu.   I received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....  
On the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me ‚Äúfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it‚Äù   
Arrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....  I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch. 
I didn‚Äôt say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù but there was nothing to be ‚Äúsorry‚Äù about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I‚Äôm not for confrontations or leading conversations, I‚Äôm very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù.... but didn‚Äôt know how.  Wife then says ‚ÄúI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.‚Äù  
Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says ‚Äúknows what?‚Äù  
She says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lie, the video‚Äù.  
I was red flushed I‚Äôm sure. My heart was beating so fast.  Then wife said she has deleted the video.  
This is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....  Then sister-in-law speaks... she says ‚Äúyou do understand this video wasn‚Äôt for you‚Äù, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.   
But then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn‚Äôt for her husband neither. He‚Äôs been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he‚Äôs been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it‚Äôs not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.  Sister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates ‚Äúfor now‚Äù. The divorce word can never go out, but she‚Äôs found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.  It was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she‚Äôs been sleeping more and more at her parents house.  Me obtaining the video didn‚Äôt come up more than once. I don‚Äôt know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I‚Äôll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.    
For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.   We will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.  Wife seemed ok for now too.",1,

What's the most intricate lie you've ever told?,728026,2,"When your partner has affairs...

When your partner has you quit your job and all of you move to another state... so she can divorce you as she couldn't work in the state you'd been in but she could work (teach) in the state you moved to.  She'd been a stay at home mom since we had our 3 children and she couldn't teach in our state with her license the way it was but she could teach in that other state.

She went off to be with ""girlfriends"" on many weekends before we moved and after we moved to that new state and of course it was to be with her paramour, I just didn't know that yet.

She took our 3 children off to his state and spent a weekend with him.

I didn't want to divorce, I was trying to keep us all together. 

Since we'd moved to another state, we were living in a rented 3 bedroom home and our home in our other state hadn't sold yet.

I came home from work one night and my wife said ""let's go"" and I asked her where and she told me to look for places for move to move into as she wanted me out.

She'd already contacted our landlord (of the 3 bedroom house we were renting) and arranged for her to show us places that evening, I just had no idea until I got home.

So, my wife was taking the lead to push me out.

After I'd moved out, I came home from work one night to find lots of my things sitting outside in the grass in the yard, for anyone to take.  My wife wanted my things out of our rental house yesterday.  This was a local move, I was taking things over little by little as I didn't live there anymore and she decided she wanted my things out NOW.

She told me she wouldn't do that again... yeah right.  The following week I drove up from work and this time I caught her in the act as there were lots of my things in the yard and she was there still taking things out of her minivan.  She said she wouldn't do that again... but it was another lie.

Less than 2 months after our divorce, she took our 3 children and moved off almost 200 miles away to another state to be with ""him"".

Oh, they didn't even make it together 3 months after she and the children got there (they didn't live together though as my ex-wife had an apartment).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaving so much out... some that should be added is that I did tons for her parent's.

Many years before, when her dad retired, we gave her parent's 2 acres of our 40 acres and they built a house behind ours using the same builder who had built our house.

Her mother and all of their belongings lived with us for 3.5 months while their house was being finished as their house sold immediately and she needed to stay somewhere so she stayed with us.  her dad still had like 5 months left to work before retiring so he stayed many states away where they had been in an extended stay type place.

When I moved for work a few years later, they followed us to that state and they lived like 2 miles from us.

In both places I did tons for them as they were older, not in good health.  I cut their grass and ours. I cleaned their tubs and showers and ours.  I cleaned their hard floors and vacuumed and I did that at our houses too.

On and on it went.",1,

What's the most intricate lie you've ever told?,2157580,2,"People are the cause of nearly every problem in every situation. They lie, cheat, steal, murder, abuse, overpopulate, overconsume, then lie some more and ignore the rampant destruction their behavior has caused when its inconvenient to confront.  They create disinformation campaigns that exploit the ignorant and uneducated instead of information campaigns to raise them up. Those without the ability to reason critically based on facts from qualified sources nevertheless formulate opinions from within echo chambers and act based on those disinformed opinions. Every progressive forward-thinking institution is being corrupted by those who either take them for granted and don't consider their preservation or want to profit from their intentional destruction. Backward thinking based on false narratives entering the mainstream is propped up as ""opinion"" rather than than a threat to the fabric of our culture and society. When these things were happening on the fringe, it was easier to shrug off. But now they seem to be the new standard, undermining many decades of cultural progress toward inclusion and informed discussion. These problems seem to be getting worse with each election and each natural or man-made disaster. 

I have 16 years of college education and 20 years of very broad advanced R&amp;D engineering experience on bleeding edge military and medical applications. I've read or speed read upwards of 1M pages of technical articles, books, philosophy, news, etc. on a range of topics, practicing intentional systematic critical reasoning and source qualification, consuming another 100-200 pages every day. I've done every mind-altering chemical with any chance of perspective altering after careful research and implementing safety precautions, including surrounding myself with people I trust.  I looked behind all the curtains, searching for something meaningful or encouraging, but all I found was an endless series of nested simulations with arbitrary content and dubious origins. 

I've been married twice, both times for stability and logistics. Using a few people for comfort seems disingenuous and selfish so does reproduction and the acceptance of the steps leading there.

What's the most intricate lie you've ever told?,3766292,2,"Things the girls (11 to 15 years) I worked with wanted to know:
- how to not get pregnant and what is the safest method
- what is a slut and how do you become one because they don‚Äôt want to be one 
- sexual assault and what to do when you get assaulted 
- lgbtq+, what does that mean and how do you know (incredibly important. While talking about this one girl came out as bisexual and after the project we got told that they want to get called a masculine name because they came out as trans)
- does it really hurt if you have sex for the first time (don‚Äôt lie, for some it hurts for others it doesn‚Äôt, but always be sure you‚Äôre ready)


In my opinion:
- consent
- sending nudes
- what‚Äôs happening during menstruation
- how a healthy relationship should be or red flags in a relationship 

To every educator: please, for the sake of the children we work with, talk to them about sex and everything that belongs to it. Ask them if they are interested and show them that they can ask you anything. They want and need answers. 
I did it through a project about puberty and asked them what they wanted to know and even if I could have done better, it was incredible because they really wanted to learn. 
BUT watch out! There are a lot of questions you can‚Äôt be prepared for and be sure to know where you stand. Only tell things about yourself, you‚Äôre comfortable with, but children may want to know how it was for you.

That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

Others I still enjoy are things like Pok√©mon/Minecraft, legos, Pok√©mon cards, and art(tbh, art is a bigger thing to me than warriors. I still make fanart for the series, but I don‚Äôt read the books as much. I also do things besides warriors, like Pok√©mon, when I draw)

I do credit the books in getting me more hooked into doing art as a hobby. I‚Äôve pretty much always loved art and been above average at it, but reading the books really stretched my creativity, party because of the unique story of the book (I would get into it, but I don‚Äôt want to write a book explaining the series lol). The book series is something that pretty begs for fanart, mostly because it‚Äôs about cats, and the appearances of them are up to the readers because there is very little official art of the characters, and even then most people don‚Äôt go by the official art, rather creating their own ideas of how the characters look based off of the descriptions in the book. A characters design is virtually guaranteed to vary in some way from person to person(unless the character is a single color, like black or white. But even then, some people (myself included) add a bit of variety to the pattern to add a bit of detail).

There are very few ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù design concepts, but they are minor. One is the character Dovewing, whose eye color was inconsistent across books (there isn‚Äôt a single author, instead it‚Äôs a team of authors that go under the alias of Erin Hunter, aka ‚ÄúThe Erins‚Äù, and this is why there are sometimes inconsistencies). It‚Äôs mostly agreed to be green, but sometimes people may draw her w/blue eyes.

Best book I've read is 'Wij Zijn Ons Brein', (we are our brains) by Dick Swaab. It's Dutch as you can maybe tell, but translated in many other languages. Unironically not cosmology but it covers loads of interesting topics regarding the fuctions of the brain.

I don't think reading makes you smart by the way, now that I think of it. But it builds knowledge and vocabulary very well. (having loads of knowledge is not the same as 'smart', I suppose. An encyclopedia is not smart)",1,

It was a show about a tall, spindly white male doctor with dark hair. Looked like a Walmart version of Coraline's dad. The protagonist was a little white girl also with dark hair, very smooth and shiny down to her shoulders. The room they were in was covered in olive-green tiles. 

He strapped her into a contraption that looked like a dentists chair but creepier and more torturous-looking. He then cut her head open and performed an operation on her brain with various oversized surgical instruments. The final scene that I can remember was a zoom-in on her split-open skull and the exposed brain. Looked like stop-motion animation.

There was something very weirdly and vaguely sexual about the scene as well, which I wasn't able to pick up on very clearly because I was about five or six at the time.

What‚Äôs the most bizarre dream you remember having?,4985548,2,"I moved into a house with one roommate who I didn't know previously, he had owned the house for a couple years at that point (we ended up becoming great friends). I knew 2 people had died in the house, the 2 prior owners (an older couple- the man died naturally I think, and his wife killed herself after his death). There was never creepy energy or anything, I always felt safe and comfortable there. Except this one night..

So I had been living there for about 2 months at this point, when my roommate went out of town for a couple weeks. It was January and pretty cold, so having the house to myself and no real bed in my room, I decided to sleep on the futon in the livingroom next to the fireplace while he was gone.

One night while I was sleeping there, I woke up from a dream that felt really important. I laid there for a couple minutes trying to make sense of it when suddenly I was startled by glass shattering right next to my head. It took me a minute to figure out what happened- there were these comedy/tragedy masks hanging above the mantle (creepy af, always hated those things), and the comedy mask had falled from the nail in the wall just onto the mantle shelf (6 or so inches). It hit a lantern and shattered the glass, the base stayed on the shelf so only glass fell. 

So in this moment I'm freaked out, a comedy mask and shattered glass are lying right next to my head and I've forgotten this dream that seemed very important. I couldn't for the life of me remember the dream, only the sense that i needed to. I was uneasy but eventually fell back asleep.

The next morning I woke up and noticed I had big dark bruises all over my legs, up and down them both. I had also started menstruating, which was not supposed to happen for another couple weeks (I had a really regular cycle). I only bled for that one day and then didn't have my period again for like 4 months. It was all super strange and I never knew what to make of it.

What‚Äôs an industry secret in the field you work in?,3966885,3,"The TL;DR comes down to 2 things

1. your dream job is still a job and still takes a shit ton of work. You can't coast or you won't make it.
2. I had a lot of advantages that helped me to it. Some are advantages I was born into. Some are advantages that I made through effort and strategy, but it does come down to me having enough advantages to try enough times to get it done without starving first.

I work in the entertainment industry designing sets and props. Everything in the film industry is a gamble. That's just how it works. Some things are pretty safe bets. Some are risky. Some pay off big, some don't pay off at all. People who really succeed in the film industry are people who got a bet to pay off well, and then invested that success into further success.

Sometimes, people get a ""big break"" and some people (like me) take lots of calculated steps to build a resume to work regularly and work on bigger and better things. Most success stories are people who could already afford to take bigger risks (or smaller risks for a longer period of time until one paid off). 

My biggest advantage: I worked 40 hours a week during HS to help pay for college and then ended up winning a full ride scholarship, so I had a bit of a nest egg to survive on while trying to build a resume for my dream job. 

That nest egg let me take jobs that looked good on the resume I was trying o build but didn't pay well enough to pay my bills. So I risked my nest egg on building a resume instead of building immediate income. For me, it paid off. For some friends of mine, it didn't. And I think that came down to me working my ass off (which they did too), and having the advantage of that nest egg that paid my bills while I was trying to break into the industry. I had advantages that gave me more endurance, more ""rolls of the dice"" than some of my friends, and that meant I had more chances of rolling high. Not because I'm better than anyone else, but because I set myself up to be able to roll the dice more times until it came up well for me.

I'm still growing, still calculating my gambles, and can now pay my bills by designing cool shit. I've art directed VMA nominated content, designed several top trending videos on youtube, designed tv for Hulu and Netflix. Some friends of mine who are just as talented in their fields as I am haven't had the success that I have enjoyed, and some have. We all gambled on our dreams. Some could afford to gamble more, some couldn't. 

So there's really no secret to making it work. You make good product/do good work, and hopefully you can set yourself up to take enough shots, and smart enough shots, to get eyeballs on what you do. Luck has a lot to do with it, but when you get lucky, you have to be able to back it up with the skills to keep going.",1,
What‚Äôs an industry secret in the field you work in?,800627,2,"I am here for the underground highway stories... I can elaborate more of what I have heard throughout the years after I sleep if anyone cares.

Edit for story time, and sorry it took so long!!!

Ok, so for anyone who has followed me for awhile they know I spent 10+ in the military and have been a tattoo artist for 11 years now. Been to Japan (they have a version of bigfoot), to Afghanistan (also bigfoot), Kuwait (bigfoot), and others.

In my travels I have met and tattooed well over 6,000 people, and to for anyone who doesn‚Äôt get tattooed, it is kind of like therapy. People get them for all different reasons, but the common theme is that people like to talk. I try to have friendly conversation with all my clients, but if anything sounds too crazy I tend to just nod my head and carry on with the tattoo.

Now that the basics are covered; I will never forget these 5 particular clients I had while tattooing in southern Arizona. 2 truckers and 3 welders to tie in 2 ridiculous sounding conspiracy theories that I may or may not fully believe... but these got me listening.

Starting with the welders, on 3 seperate occassions I tattooed union types who claimed to be on a massive government contract, whose sole purpose was welding shackles into cattle cars. I tattooed them for about 6 months and they showed me pictures and video... said that for 10 hours a day they fitted cattle cars with chains and shackles. That was nearly a decade ago, so take it as you will. No one has been rounded up yet.

The most fascinating 2 clients, with the coolest stories though, were these 2 truckers. Tattooed them every time they were in town. The first, let‚Äôs call him Jim, said he worked for a government contracted shipping company and all his work entailed was driving cargo into the mountains, driving past military checkpoints, into a circular door cut into the mountain, and dropping the cargo off into a staging area tall enough to park a small skyscraper. Jim said he saw huge tunnels leading off of this chamber, and trucks coming and going with cargo, but his clearance let him into the staging area to unload and then leave, no more.

So, needless to say I was skeptical. Like, yea, I worked for the alphabet soup and know all about some of the mountain retreats and missle silos, but really, underground highways? Staging areas you can walk a mecha through? Quit pulling my chain...

That was until about 2-3 months later when I met Bill. Bill said he was a trucker and when I asked what he carried he said all the secret cargo. I asked him, ‚Äúso like all the covered stuff you see on the highway‚Äù, and his reply was just ; no, the stuff too dangerous or off the books that you never see it on the highway. Since the thoughts of Jim‚Äôs stories were still in my mind, I asked if he meant the underground highway and Bill lit up like crazy. Like he was tired of having his work discounted. He went of for the entire session about the crazy weapons and biohazard shit he hauled around on, ‚Äúthe great American underground highway‚Äù; his words.

As Bill explained it, and corroborated Jim‚Äôs story, the underground drivers are different from the aboveground so as maintain seperation and levels of secrecy. All the doors are guarded by blackop types and the scale is simply off the charts. He said that the entire nation was connected underground via these tunnels, but only near major cities were there access points; and those were usually hidden in the mountains. Just thousands of miles of giant tunnels deep underground being driven soley by government contract truckers hauling ultra sensative gear.

I don‚Äôt know how true these stories are because I have never seen them, nor can I provide any proof; but 2 strangers sharing a similar story definitely makes your stop and pause. Thanks for listen to me ramble about my interesting interactions over the years!",1,

What‚Äôs an industry secret in the field you work in?,2157364,2,"I developed a porn addiction at a very young age that has ruined my life, at 21 years old I still struggle with it.

When I was around 4 or 5 years old I first discovered porn/masturbation and was instantly drawn towards it as it was something that was exciting and could be used at something to relieve stress and as something that could be enjoyed. Since I was never really educated about porn/masturbation/sex I grew up not having a full understanding of what it was and how I played a role in society and when interacting with others as well as being a private person I never felt comfortable being able to discuss anything about this to anyone and have a still never talked about this to anyone in my life. Growing up it was a huge secret and a large part of my life that I never discussed with anyone as I was very uncomfortable talking about anything in my life to anyone. When I was young I was a an outgoing and sociable person but as I hit puberty I became a very socially anxious and depressed person which caused me to prefer to be at home alone where over time porn began to become a much more frequent activity to the point where it became something that was part of my daily routine and something that I was doing multiple times a day not  knowing of the negative effects that it has on a child/young teenager. As I reached high school I had become extremely socially anxious and depressed to the point where I was terrified of being in public or talking to people that were outside of my immediate group of friends. Also around this time porn/masturbation had become such an addiction to the point where I began having a large loss in the overall enjoyment and in the physical sensitivity of my phallic friend. This led to me having trouble with erections and being able to finish which took a huge hit on my confidence and self esteem. When I reached college I was still anxious and depressed so I had never actively pursued a girlfriend in high school so I had never had sex or even kissed a girl. In the first month of living in college residence a girl came to my room and after talking for a while she said that she was attracted to me and she began to kiss me. After a while she started to give me a blowjob but I was unable to feel a single thing, it was as if she wasn't even doing anything and there was not a single chance that I was even going to finish. This led to me awkwardly saying that I couldn't feel anything which made me feel humiliated. After that night I had just thought that the reason I didn't feel anything was because I was very nervous and it was my first time. A couple weeks later a different girl wanted to have sex with me so we did but even then I couldn't feel anything and was unable to really know what I was doing as I had no feeling although luckily I was able to finish after quite a while. But yet again I just summed it up to just being nervous. After that I became close friends with another girl and we became sort of a friends with benefits kinda thing. We would frequently engage in having sex but each time I would barely feel anything which caused me to be worrying if I was even hard or not and would have a hard time finishing and even then it would be weak orgasms. This is where I began to realize that this wasn't from being nervous as me and this girl were very close and I was comfortable with her. Even though we were close I still never told her what I was dealing with. In my second year of college after she had finished her program and moved home I was very depressed as early in the school year of 2nd year I had a falling out two of my closest and oldest friends back home who had taken advantage of a girl(she was a close friend of our friends girlfriend) that I had been talking to and we had become quite into each other but she didn't think it would work with me not being in our hometown that often. After that night I became very depressed and began to have issues trusting others because of that. Since I was going to school in a different city and didn't know anyone and being very depressed I spent nearly all of my time alone in my room where I wasn't taking care of myself. At this point porn had almost completely taken over my life as it was really the only thing that gave me the slightest bit of pleasure in my life. But the frequency in doing over time has caused my nerves to become numb and I hope to God that it is nothing permanent. Near the end of my second year of my program (it was only a 2 year program) I began to read up on pornography and addiction to which I realized that I was very much addicted to it and was realizing how much it can have a negative affect on your mind and body, especially when your young. I am now 21 years old back at home studying engineering and trying to deal with quitting masturbation/porn so that I can potentially have the life that I would have had if I never discovered porn at a young age. With the pandemic going on and having lots of free time to myself I see it as a second chance in life to work on my myself and change who I am for the better. Even to this day I have never told a single person about my struggle with pornograpgy.

All of this has caused me to feel like I will never be able have a relationship or love someone as currently I struggle with being able to perform and am unable to feel any emotional connection or any pleasure during intercoms and during anything else. My whole life I have been very lonely and isolated.",1,
What‚Äôs an industry secret in the field you work in?,2744181,2,"Since conspiracy theory hidden nukes guy deleted their comment, im posting mine here.

Nukes are a pain to maintain, costly, and really only work with MAD. They are only effective as obvious threats for major powers. (Yes, I know the arguements for limited, tactical nuke usage against a nuke power state. Limited nuke warfare can happen, but you most likely escalate it to MAD anyways.) Once you can blow up the world a few times, it doesn't really matter about the number or types of nukes you have, but rather your delivery capabilities/where they are.

 You may not want the enemy to know where your subs and nukes are, but you want them to believe that they are just off their coast and armed. Missile delivery and missile defense tech are what you really want to keep relatively secret once you reach a certain point. For instance, NK benefits if they can prove that they posses missiles that can hit the US, as it deters the US from invading. Meanwhile, everyone knows the US can target anywhere. The real question for major powers is how to still utilize the diplomatic benefits of MAD while cheating by building anti-missile tech.

Secret nukes really only work in two occassions: terrorists or countries that would be diplomatically harmed from it being known. For instance, Israel is the best worst kept secret for having nukes. They will deny it, but everyone knows that they 99% have them. By denying it, they are able to avoid sanctions and are able to keep regional enemies at bay. See Iran, South Africa, Pakistan, and South Korea for what happens when your rivals consider you a threat for having/working towards nukes. If you arent part of the nuclear power club, everyone will work to their benefit to avoid you having them. Less nuclear powers= more influence/stability for nuclear powers. Additionally, the do-they,don't-they have nukes question actually helps Israel, since their regional enemies have to think twice about invading and are more likely to lean towards limited warfare.

The only real secrets that you want to have are your true ability to produce effective nukes as a non-nuclear power, whether through research or secret transfers. Everyone knows that Japan meets all the tech requirements to become a nuclear power. Without US protection, they might actually pursue it. Everyone knows this and benefits from the current relationship (one less nuclear power and greater international/domestic political stability). In this case, that knowledge helps further secure US/JP ties. If the US were to leave Japan, they would likely try to hide their capabilities until push came to shove with China in the distant future. Also, deals between nations to transfer nukes are also a thing that is best kept secret. Rumor has it that Saudi Arabia has a deal to receive nukes in certain, specific situations. The existence of said rumors benefits SA, but the specifics would cause enemies to second guess the benefits of attacking.

What‚Äôs an industry secret in the field you work in?,4491065,2,"This happened an hour ago, and I‚Äôm still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....  
There‚Äôs 2 ‚Äúsituations‚Äù that leads to the conclusion of the FU.  
First situation:  

Asked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to. 
Found out the memory card still had content.  
Her husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 ‚Äúporn‚Äù video, assuming sent to him a while back.    I‚Äôve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.  
A certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.  
So finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I‚Äôve always fantasized about, ‚Äúgifting my past self‚Äù, while living my happy current life.  

Second accident:  
I have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.  

Wife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it‚Äôs useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she‚Äôs at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.  
 Last night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?  
I have the day off today, today was the day I‚Äôd do the ‚Äúdeed‚Äù. I don‚Äôt only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience. 
This would have lasted me tops 5 mins.    
But the ‚Äúforeplay‚Äù she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.  
Wife‚Äôs phone didn‚Äôt give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.  
She comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.  
She knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.  
But VR porn was never ‚Äúdiscussed‚Äù as an ‚Äúis it cheating if....‚Äù thing. You know the convo I‚Äôm talking about, ‚Äúis it cheating if you have a sex doll‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if it‚Äôs a robot‚Äù, ‚Äúis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time‚Äù, etc...  
It was the type of convo we‚Äôd have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let‚Äôs say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we‚Äôre on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.  
Anyways, VR wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúthing‚Äù back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù for me to do so. I guess it was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That‚Äôs when I see her in the room.  
‚ÄúThe fuck??‚Äù she says.   
Then she looks inside.  
‚ÄúIs that my sister?!?!‚Äù   
I‚Äôm fucked.  
She still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.  
Seeing from the tracking app... she‚Äôs at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.  
I‚Äôm fucked.  

TL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law‚Äôs 360 porn video, got caught in the act, now feeling out of body experience and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen

Found the edit 
 UPDATE: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that‚Äôs when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it‚Äôs called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.  
I was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.  
So basically... after posting... after feeling a ‚Äúbit‚Äù better by ‚Äútelling someone‚Äù and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...  
This went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn‚Äôt focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying ‚ÄúCall me‚Äù. I left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn‚Äôt help as I didn‚Äôt focus once on Detective Pikachu.   I received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....  
On the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me ‚Äúfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it‚Äù   
Arrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....  I get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch. 
I didn‚Äôt say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù but there was nothing to be ‚Äúsorry‚Äù about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I‚Äôm not for confrontations or leading conversations, I‚Äôm very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù.... but didn‚Äôt know how.  Wife then says ‚ÄúI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.‚Äù  
Fucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says ‚Äúknows what?‚Äù  
She says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lie, the video‚Äù.  
I was red flushed I‚Äôm sure. My heart was beating so fast.  Then wife said she has deleted the video.  
This is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....  Then sister-in-law speaks... she says ‚Äúyou do understand this video wasn‚Äôt for you‚Äù, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.   
But then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn‚Äôt for her husband neither. He‚Äôs been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he‚Äôs been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it‚Äôs not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.  Sister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates ‚Äúfor now‚Äù. The divorce word can never go out, but she‚Äôs found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.  It was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she‚Äôs been sleeping more and more at her parents house.  Me obtaining the video didn‚Äôt come up more than once. I don‚Äôt know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I‚Äôll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.    
For tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke.

What‚Äôs the most beautiful artwork you‚Äôve ever seen?,839568,2,"I enjoy weightlifting. The act of doing it makes me feel strong and powerful. It's the same kind of feeling you get when you do anything you've gotten good at. ""Look at what I can do! I remember when I couldn't do this, and now I can. And tomorrow I will be even better.""

And that feeling of strength is very primal, very elementary. When a musician plays a challenging piece that tests their abilities to the limit, they feel pride in their ability to create beautiful music. When you lift weight that pushes your physical strength to its limits, you feel proud of your body - that's extremely personal and raw, and it's about as close as possible to simply feeling pride in yourself.

I'm not trying to say weightlifting is something everyone can or should enjoy. The exact same logic applies to running, and I don't like running much at all. But I can definitely understand the people that do, and believe that they truly enjoy it.",1,

It was beautiful; no light pollution, hardly a cloud in the sky.
So we decided to just watch the stars for some time and after a while, we see this giant rock-like object fly across our field of view.
 Now, I know what you're thinking, seeing a space rock is one of the things you are kind of expecting to see while staring out into the abyss.

 This is where it gets a little weird. The thing moved slow, but only by our perception as the thing also look absolutely gargantuan. It was also emitting this blue flame-like gaseous substance out from what looked like its craters. It moved silently, either it was large enough to be out of the atmosphere or it already entered the atmosphere. Heres the thing, though, if it were in our atmosphere i dont think it wouldnt have had a smoke trail and more turbulence around it as the air friction eroded the outer layers of whatever this object was. 
So it was large, lumbering but still fast, maybe outside of the atmosphere because if it were that large I think waaay more people would know about this large rock flying about over the great lakes.

What's the most beautiful location you've ever visited?,5455391,2,"I used to work, during the summers, in the games department at a local amusement park.

(*Not Disney!)*

Our department has a bit of an unspoken policy towards over hiring early in the season, because we tend to lose a lot of our new hires due to them finding a better job, something that pays better, something that offers more hours, something indoors, and we tend to lose new hires on occasion to other departments. So, by about the time we go ""full season"" in June, 7 days a week, 12-hours a day, we've whittled down the people who weren't going to make it and who didn't like the job or weren't a good enough fit, down to the people who are going to stick it out with us for the summer.

We had one guy who started with us after the ""easy"" part of the season. He jumped in and got hired right when we were going to full time hours.

I won't give you his name, because I forgot it. But suffice it to say, he didn't last that long.

I was tasked with training him on his first day. I caught up with him in the morning, went over our training binder full of materials with him. Got him all set up. He was in a fairly isolated location, where a lot of our managers don't tend to stop by and check on people, because its a little out of the way. So I showed him where the phone was, in case he needed to call our office and get a hold of someone if there was a problem, he had questions, he had a problem customer. Easy deal, right?

This job is an easy gig. He was in the shade. It was actually a hockey themed game, where all he had to do was press a button to start a 40-second timer, watch people try to hit targets, and when people hit targets he'd give them a prize based on how many they hit. Super simple. And it never got that busy. It was a $10 game and hard to do well at, unless you were actually kind of good at hockey. So this kid should have had it easy.

Now I don't know exactly what happens, aside from hearing about it later. But apparently this new kid decided, even though he was under cover and out of the sun at a game where you barely have to move, he was ""too hot"". So he shuffled on down to our medical people during his lunch, didn't tell anybody else where he was going, and spent the rest of his shift there.

When our department big shots found out he'd basically abandoned his spot for half a day without telling anyone, he was gone. Never saw him again.

We also had a new kid who only lasted 3 days or so.

I trained him too.

Kid was probably 18 and couldn't figure out how to tie his own apron. (We weren't cooking, but we had aprons for our money. We didn't use registers except for in a few places.)

I had to tie his apron.

They put me right next door to this guy, so I could help him out and also watch his spot (and my own) when he had his lunch.

He came back 10 minutes late from lunch. On his first day.

He was 18, but he was still finishing up his Senior year in High School. In our state, even when you're 18, if you have class, you can't work during school hours. We have a few weekdays at the start of every season, usually 11 AM-5 PM for local schools and groups to come and have catered events and field trips.

""Mr. Can't Tie My Apron"" never told anyone he was still in school. He was 18, so legally, he could work whenever he was needed.

Until he no-call, no-showed because he had an exam to take.

And then his next shift, he was canned because he forgot he had a doctor's appointment and sent our ""Big Boss"" -- like our boss' boss' boss -- an e-mail saying such. Instead of just calling the office and letting his normal, day-to-day boss know. He tried going over her head to the big shot, so he didn't get in trouble.

Needless to say, it didn't pan out.

Anyway, long story short -- People are idiots.",1,

Im her only child, and this woman was the kind of person to give all she could to help anyone in need. Then she started to be a lil forgetful, started loosing things, then moved south for better job opportunities. Down there she had trouble keeping even the simplest of jobs and eventually got fired from KFC, she was an accountant turned cashier. Then some family who she had been staying with and over staying her welcome became distant and cold. Then she got diagnosed. Two or three years of her living down there before she moved back here, home. In my care. It was sad to see first hand how ""family"" treated her. Like an invalid that didn't understand anything. The most belittling I've ever seen. Introducing my mother to people like her middle name was Alzheimer's. She was by no means that bad at this point. It was shameful to see my mother catching them in lies about not wanting to spend time with her. Heartbreaking to see that look on my mothers face knowing she would most likely never see these people again once they left her with me, and they didnt care. People she had helped raise, gotten jobs under her, trained them how to do accounting. But couldn't be bothered to be honest, let alone attend her funeral. This went on for years, one friend after another disappeared because it ""was too hard to see her like this"". Until it was just her and I. Once I got her into an LTC home the first month a worker had sex with her. Of course it couldn't be proven and the more we talked to my mother about it  the more it would solidify the memory. So i catered to the sweeping it under the rug. Something im not sure if i regretted or not.  After that i started asking my aunt (from my fathers side who they divorced when i was five,) she was a retired nurse of 50 years. I should have done this earlier. If you have read this long at least learn if your dealing with any medical establishment you need an advocate that knows the system so they dont take advantage of you!! Bringing her was the best day, yearly care conference of me (mid twenty kid) and five or six professionals across from me at a board table.

Im over on the side....""im gunna eat this cake here"" 
In the end my mother would mistake me for her brother that never visited, then lost more and more facilities. I would come to the home and find her sun burnt all up one side while the help tell me she loves the view by the window. This sort of thing was typical, bed sores and bloodclots from being neglected until she passed. I don't blame the staff for it, they are  over worked and understaffed for profit.

What's the most beautiful location you've ever visited?,1974956,2,"My neighbor had what I suspect was dementia and untreated type 2 diabetes, along with some sort of mild intellectual or cognitive impairment, plus lived her life with untreated/poorly managed schizophrenia. Supposedly, she was supposed to be on disability with her two children and had a case manager/social workers. She lived in a small 2 bedroom house with the adult children, who were abusive and some random guy she was married to (but he wasn't the father of the two kids.) She was always dirty and smelled a bit, but was nice and we were polite and I was too young to really know enough to call adult protection services myself. I mostly remember it was very obvious she needed some kind of independent living or caretaker, but there was no real help (early 90s, inner city.)

Eventually the guy had enough of living with her and the ""kids"" in squalor and left. The house got dirtier and eventually the kids kicked their mom out (they had ongoing bouts of psychosis and a lot of the mental problems their mother had and were unable to take care of themselves.) The house got condemned and the police/state were involved. They found a lot of dead animals in bedrooms and literal garbage up to the ceiling. The plumbing didn't even work.

Around this time we took her to the mall to get her out of the house/to calm her down and treated her to McDonalds in the food court, she couldn't walk more than a few feet without complaining her feet hurt too much to move. She also didn't really seem to understand where she was and had huge issues navigating anything. She ended up running into glass storefronts, doors and windows. She'd laugh it off, but we were pretty worried and took her back to the motel where she was staying.

We lost contact with her and her daughter for sometime, and then found out she was living with her in another motel down the street that was notorious for prostitution, and drug dealing, etc. It probably should've been demolished but nobody ever got around to dealing with it. The son ran off somewhere and didn't come back. Eventually the daughter kicked the mom out of the room for the majority of the day by the time some serious dementia set in, and she would wander various stores and soil herself in public, loiter, buy a coffee and sit all day in various McDonalds. People either called the police or chased her out because she would deficate all over the seats and not really notice or care. Then, she came back to the motel and the daughter was gone.

Someone called the police on her eventually and she was taken into some kind of state-run nursing home where we visited her and my folks bought her clothing because she literally didn't have anything the nursing home didn't already provide her with (a pair of pjs and sweatpants mostly.) I last remember seeing her and she was having problems feeding herself, and continued eating despite being covered in her own poop, since she wasn't changed frequently.

As we played with it, some of the strangest and most terrifying things started to happen. What was perhaps most terrifying was a stranger who visited us shortly after we used it. Definitely not common since the home we were in was in the middle of no where. 

The whole night this stranger tried to get into the home we were in. Banging on the walls outside the house and ever trying to climb in through the windows. Eventually my cousin and I made it out but when the police arrived, there was no signs that anyone tried to break in. The only thing they found was that the floor was covered in murky water. 

I‚Äôve shared this story a few times over the years, and during my recent visit to a paranormal investigator I got a theory. The theory was that a burglar attempted to break in, but by using the ouija board, my aunt returned to stop him. Strange yes. Unbelievable I know. But this is really the only theory that anybody gave me that attempted to explain what happened that night.

 Lost their route in the middle of the night and entered forest area and encountered with tribals, they tried to talk to them and asked for the way out as tribals had little knowledge about local languages n they responded, tribals looked kind and generous, they told everyone to stay because it's not safe to travel at night, everyone agreed because tribals were kind.

Offered everyone food(non vegetarian), the food was delicious(he told me it was the tastiest meat he ever ate) everyone liked it. 
After some time my grandfather noticed something in his plate where it looked like a nile of human foot finger and he got panic then his cousin observed a thumb finger in his plate n confirmed it was human meat which they ate.

Granpa n his cousins acted normal, finished their dinner n asked them where to go for nature's call, tribals looked at each other and one of them took ropes from the roof of the hut and tied it to everyone and let them go to nature's call next to a tree, granpa n cousins opened the knots of each other n tied it to the tree and ran away, they didn't stop until they find a town.

Space is big. Beyond comprehension big.

FTL doesn't exist.

Wormholes are theoretical.

String theory, with its 11 dimensions, appears to be mathematically impossible.

That leaves generation ships as the only viable method of interstellar travel.

Space is also dangerous. Gamma rays, x-rays, solar flares, micrometeorites (a single atom at even an achievable speed could destroy an entire ship), hard vacuum, loss of bone density, etc. etc. Combine that with the complications of carrying massive amounts of oxygen and the water needed for a population of a minimum of 98 humans (the lowest population that would avoid inbreeding) and growing food, mission drift -- and that's for humans, we have no way of guessing how complex aliens might be.

*If*, and that's a big if, an alien population evolved to the point of interstellar travel, they'd have to find us, one Goldilocks planet among 300 million in the Milky Way. We've been broadcasting for about 100 years, a tiny blip of time in the cosmological scheme of things, they could have died out millions of years ago, they might have technologies that would never detect radio waves, *they'd have to be looking for us*, they'd have to give a shit about us, they might not even be born yet, the list goes on.

Even if we're not alone, for all intents and purposes, we *are* alone.

Besides, we seem to be doing a really good job of killing ourselves, so *if* there really are aliens, and *if* they solved all those problems I listed, and *if* they are here, all they'd really need to do is wait.

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.


Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.

You are not as fat as you imagine.


Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.


Do one thing every day that scares you.


Sing.


Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.


Floss.


Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.


Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.


Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.


Stretch.


Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.


Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.


Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.


Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.


Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.


Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.


Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.


Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.


Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.


Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. 


Travel.


Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.


Respect your elders.


Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.


Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.


Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.

Immediately start considering the implications of me, a gay white guy, being the leader of a completely black, 90% Christian (65% Catholic) nation. Same Sex relations are also a crime there. 

My first step would be to go back into the closet and go back to my Roman Catholic roots. Just for my own survival. I would also announce my intention to resign after serving two terms (I know I can't resign, but Burundi has a long history of Couping their long-serving leaders)

The next step would be to increase control over their already state controlled media, propaganda becomes the word of the day. I would also start with some anti Rwanda talk blaming them for everything, damn Rwandans...

Burundi Nationalist &amp; Pro-Christian media will be everywhere, the people of Burundi will be expected to 

The next step would be to start shilling internationally, mostly trying to play up the new ""Christian"" lead administration so I'd probably try and get money from the US in some way, getting money on international Christian Charities will be a big thing as well. 

The plan will then be to start my own religious sect, with a new new testament, called Burundi Catholicism or something. It will become the state religion and will promote a more liberal lifestyle with alcohol &amp; drug use, gambling, prostitution, equality between men and women, LGBT rights, ect. all being slowly drip fed into the narrative. 

Once I've got a bit more money, I'd spend a large part of it on building up the army. I'd build schools for soldiers children, hospitals for soldiers &amp; their families, training grounds, ect, ect. The Army will be directly responsible for policing and security in the nation, a tough war on crime will need to be fought.

I'd also spend money on developing mines &amp; factories to get as much of the, very tiny, deposits of natural resources out of the ground and sold. 

Only then will I start being able to address the food shortages problems. The first step will be to take most of the land into state ownership. Then smaller but more efficiently organised farms will be established - rather than the current system where sprawling inefficient farms are owned by individuals, they will operate in a cooperative manner with the workers receiving a share of the food as well as their wages. A programme of reforestation will also be undertaken. 

I would also start the mass farming of insects into food and heavily promote insect based cooking among the population.

And this point I would also start actively promoting the use of contraceptives among the population, making sure women have full control over their reproductive rights. As ordered by Burundi &amp; God of course. Giving women control of their reproductive rights is one of the best ways to bring a community out of poverty &amp; this would also help with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 

The country should be shaping up a bit nicer at this point and so I would set my sights to tourism to bring in extra revenue. The first step will be to establish a ""City of God"" where one can go to live the virtues of Burundi Catholicism to the fullest. Alcohol, drug use, prostitution, gambling, ect. will all be legal and encouraged (But controlled by the state for profit!) kinda authoritarian, but kinda liberal as well?

Then slowly but surely push the country further and further into becoming the place to visit for all your darkest desires. Establish more financial services, ect. Establish the country as a tax haven for either the super rich to visit, spend loads of money and then keep the rest of their money in our banks or for criminals around the world to launder their money through.

Burundi also has uranium and so I'd secretly start a nuclear project while also being super friendly with the USA, funnelling money into the Democratic &amp; Republican parties in exchange for better relations and government money in return. 

At the culmination of my nuclear project I would direct my army to invade those damn Rwandans and being the process again, threatening to nuke anyone who interferes with me - but my buddy the USA will probably be fine with it, because I'll let them have the Rwandan oil. 

That should do it.",1,
What's your favorite piece of trivia to share at parties?,5444517,2,"No. For one, the study has its merits. I don't doubt the connection between religious attitudes and moral incongruence. Second, it IS an opinion piece. It wasn't the study that was linked. It was an article going far beyond the scope of the study to make overly-confident assertions. Lastly, one piece of evidence does not give a comprehensive view of an issue. There's still tons of research showing the harm of pornography. There's still the issue of how harm is defined and measured. There's still the issue of the distortions caused directly by the porn industry.

That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

What's your favorite piece of trivia to share at parties?,3638888,2,"Oh man definitely clothes! I can specifically remember feeling this way a time or two in my life when I realized it was time to get rid of a favorite shirt or especially a favorite hoodie. I tend to relate certain clothing to people/relationships, either because that person got me that clothing, inspired my style in some way, or simply because I wore that piece of clothing a lot while I was around that person. So sometimes the sentimental attachment goes much, much deeper than ‚ÄúI really love this sweatshirt‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love how this looks on me/feels/‚Äúetc.

What's your favorite piece of trivia to share at parties?,3952087,2,"It has a certain reputation and some people don't really look past weebs being weebs and glorifying japan (when really it's just a small part of their culture). Or they only think of it as ""big tiddie anime girl"" and think that's the only reason to watch. But Yu Yu Hakusho was also on american TV in the 90's, same as dragonball Z, but DBZ caught on way harder. 

Ultimately anime as a whole is just a very broad media. There are thousands upon thousands of shows, some of them are such ridiculous concepts that would never fly in any other context. Like Assassination Classroom is about this super-species alien that one day blows up 70% of the moon and then announces he will destroy earth in one year. After all the nations of the world try to kill him with missles and fighter jets and things, he requests that he wants to train a classroom of middle schooler misfits to be world-class assassins and to kill him. And it is so genuinely funny and sweet and you really root for the kids to kill him. And he's rooting for it to happen to! 

I'd also recommend Hunter X Hunter as maybe the first show to watch. I can't help but see that as just the best piece of fiction written that I have engaged with in my life. The character development, mood, plot, animation, etc is just unparalleled. There were parts that I was on the edge of my seat so stressed just hoping for someone to win a battle or to overcome an obstacle. Absolutely fantastic show, written by the same guy who made Yu Yu Hakusho, but it's a bit more current style of anime (was released in 2011 as opposed to the early 90s).

And yeah it sounds stupid but most western TV really bores me. Most shows seem to drag things out in a way that only keep you placated to watch the next episode, without going anywhere or if they do it takes them a whole season to get there. Obviously there are exceptions, Fargo is one of my favorite shows, I liked stranger things, The Sopranos is one of the best shows ever written. But a lot of netflix shows just seem crappy to me, obviously this is a personal preference haha. Sorry if this a way longer reply than you were expecting btw! Lol.",1,

The woman and child begin to back away, but are stopped by the wall behind them. The child clutches to the woman. The man gestures with the knife. The woman begins to open her purse.

SCP-2800 enters into view, behind the masked man. SCP-2800 proceeds to walk up to the masked man, and punch him in the lower back and chest. The man recoils in pain, and it is seen that SCP-2800 had left several spines in the masked man's back.

SCP-2800 proceeds to tie the man's hands. The woman is seen to shake SCP-2800's hand vigorously, and embrace him. SCP-2800 kneels on the ground. The child is seen to embrace SCP-2800. SCP-2800 appears to be emotional.

The woman makes a call. The child is seen to pull out a piece of paper, and write something on the paper. As SCP-2800 begins to walk away, the child calls it back. The child hands SCP-2800 the paper. SCP-2800 writes something on the paper, and hands it back to the child. Shortly after, police officers arrive on the scene.",1,
What's your favorite piece of trivia to share at parties?,8262919,2,"My favorite music from gaming is the Kingdom Hearts soundtrack. Phenomenal music, never thought I‚Äôd listen to orchestral in my life but here I am haha. Favorite track is Vector to the Heavens, a really beautiful piece of music. Honorable mention to Sanctuary.

My favorite soundtrack in anime is Attack on Titan‚Äôs OST. I could pick any song from there and it would be a banger, Hiroyuki Sawano is fucking godlike. I think my absolute favorites is between Call Your Name and Apple Seed, with an honorable mention to You See Big Girl.",1,

What's something you wish was no longer taboo in society?,4301407,2,"I work construction and a lot of people I know from work  are immigrants and a lot of people I know from work hate immigrants, even some immigrants hate other immigrants. I‚Äôm not sure why they hate other immigrants but I think it‚Äôs a competitive thing. As in they have to fight each other for their idea of what the AmErIcAn DrEaM is. Now I posses no serious education I‚Äôm not well traveled and I know nothing of politics and economics. That being said in my personal experience I have noticed that those who see immigrants in a negative light do so because they work for cheaper and devalue the labor of everyone who does that same job. Now I know that it‚Äôs those who take advantage of these people and exploit their labor that actually devalues the labor of the rest of us. Though a lot of people don‚Äôt understand that and all they see is on a daily basis is more and more immigrants working around them for cheaper and cheaper wether they be Irish, Russian, Moldovian, Brazilian, Mexican etc etc it doesn‚Äôt matter.  What then happens is certain extremists attach their racist xenophobic bullshit to immigration no longer making it about the negative impacts immigration can have on people and their vocation. Again I will restate that these negative impacts are in no way the responsibility of immigrants, my best guess is how our country handles immigration is responsible. So you ask how someone can hate immigrants who pay taxes and billionaires who don‚Äôt, I think it‚Äôs because these folks see their jobs becoming less and less valued less and less safe and they don‚Äôt see the billionaire who are fucking them on a daily basis they see the immigrant whose getting fucked right along with them on a daily basis. I‚Äôm not sure or my point here really not every immigrant pays taxes and I‚Äôm sure not every billionaire doesn‚Äôt pay taxes. Painting with a bit of a broad brush I‚Äôd say. 

TLDR: I feel these people hate immigrants because immigration run improperly can fuck with someone‚Äôs job. It‚Äôs easier for them to blame the person they see every day more so then it is to blame the person actually fucking them. This is a guess but I think it‚Äôs really rooted in how our society views employment like it‚Äôs some kind of gift. We should be thankful for the job we have like 8 hours work 8 hours pay isn‚Äôt an equal exchange you gotta be willing to do/put up with a little extra to deserve a job because your employer in their infinite kindness and generosity has offered the opportunity for them to make money off your back.",1,

What's something you wish was no longer taboo in society?,6680968,1,"It's just cultural norms and how a person is raised.  There is no rhyme or reason as to why some animals are ok and others not ok to eat - it just depends on where and how someone is raised that determines their meat preferences.  Some people think eating cows is ok (such as the US), others don't (such as India).  Some people think eating horses is ok (such as Mexico), other's don't (such as in the US).  So really it comes down to regional and religious preferences as to which meats are taboo and which meats are ok.",1,

What's something you wish was no longer taboo in society?,7457675,1,"I think it can be romanticised because it's taboo. People want the forbidden fruit and all that.

There's this cultural idea that death is bad, and suicide is bad, and that dying is the worst possible thing ever.

This is why people oppose things like euthanasia. They'd rather Granny suffer for years in a hospice because her dying is intolerable to *them*.

If people just accept death, and come to terms with, all the weight behind suicide would go away and we'd likely see far fewer people working themselves up into a state where they make poor attempts.",1,

My racist neighbors that hate the black family across the street and hate me because I'm not an apologetic white person can keep going their own thing and I'll keep doing mine.

Racist people in packs are fucking scary because they will literally beat you physically if they can get away with it. We've seen this on a small scale with towns in the 90's and even 2000's, but imagine a single planet, or state, or continent filled with racists. Eventually once race will end all of the others there and become the ""superior race"". After that it's downhill for everyone else whose normal in society on the other planet.",1,
