He routinely failed to pay contractors and employees, made pathetically terrible attempts to diversify his business (Trump steaks?

He paid a C-tier pornstar $130,000 to have sex with him, and she described his penis as looking like the character Toad from Mario. Half the country hates his guts, as he didn’t even try to fulfill the president’s most important goal: uniting the country. He’s also barely able to speak English.

{"docid": 12493, "augmented_text": "What is a history fact that is so stupid it doesn't seem real? The date set for the Independence of India and transfer of power from the British to the Government of India was not a planned decision. Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, during a press event was asked by a reporter if a date was decided by him, to which he replied impromptu with 15th of August 1947. \n\nLater when Mountbatten was asked why he had chosen 15th August, he replied with the following:  “the date I chose came out of the blue. I chose it in reply to a question. I was determined to show I was master of the whole event. When they asked had we set a date, I knew it had to be soon. I hadn’t worked it out exactly then — I thought it had to be about August or September and I then went out to the 15th August. Why? Because it was the second anniversary of Japan’s surrender.” \n\nTo add on to the story, because Mountbatten hastily preponed the transfer, the British Raj called upon a cartographer who had no idea about India. He was put in charge of dividing India and Pakistan. There was no surveying of the place done, no studying of demographics done. The cartographer seemed to have drawn boundaries which suited his liking. This caused massive panic in India. An estimate of around 2 million people died post Partition in India as they had to literally shift countries and end up in alien place where they would restart their entire lives.\n\nThe boundaries drawn weren't logical yet the British Raj went with it. Today, this stupid boundary is the reason India and Pakistan have conflicts.\n\nThis may not sound as stupid as some of the other replies here, but when you account the magnitude of impact some stupid cartographer's map has had on the world, it sounds sadly stupid.\n\n(This post is for those who have no idea about the impact of the British Rule which extends to the modern day world) history fact set date august 1947 mountbatten asked india transfer"}

{"docid": 104983, "augmented_text": "What reasons cause so many women to demand so much from a relationship but offer very little? Now first off I want to say: NOT EVERY WOMAN IS LIKE THIS AT ALL. I had a very wonderful girlfriend that I’m going to make my fiancé who’s nothing like this, and have ex’s in the past who were nothing like this. HOWEVER, I believe that this can be stemmed from basically gender roles in the past. If you take a look at the past, well, pretty much all of history, males have been the breadwinner. In the caveman days, men would be the muscular ones to hunt and provide food. This goes all the way up really until WW2 when it stopped. Men were the ones to go to work, earn the money, pay the bills, while the wife tended the home. Considering this mainly only changed in WW2, where the men went to war and the women took over factories and many other workplaces. I’m in no way saying this is the way it should have been, it just was. With this, we still see a HUGE pressure on men to be the providers, to be making the living for their family. As a result, I would say it just provides that unconscious bias towards the idea that men should be the ones giving. In conclusion, gender roles still exist in today’s society, causing the underlying expectation for men to be the providers, in aspects other than just money. As this notion evidently carries on into many other roles. women demand provide food males breadwinner living family changed ww2"}

Dont expect her to lower her standards if you won't.\n3) she doesnt owe you anything\n4) nice isnt a personality, I had no personality, I was just generally agreeable.

Honestly I appreciate you asking.\n\nI was actually ready to vote for Biden this time around about a month ago, although I actually thought Trump would win. The election results were not remotely surprising to anyone on the right, to be honest. I'm actually surprised they weren't more off. I *was* surprised at the degree to which Trump did better with minorities. I thought he would do better, but not that much better.\n\nThe reason I was ready to vote for him is the same reason I'm hopeful about what he's been saying for the past week. His messaging seemed to be entirely focused on unity and stoping the vilification of our enemies. Biden's campaign, at the very least, seems to have picked up on exactly what my comment is about. It seemed like every Biden sponsored commercial I was seeing was some version of \"even if you disagree with me we can come together\" messaging.\n\nSo I was very much liking that. My wife and I went on a walk and were talking about things a couple weeks ago and we both agreed that we couldn't stomach voting for Trump again, and that we planned to vote for Biden.\n\nThen the last debate came around a few days later where Biden said in no uncertain terms that his administration would be looking at moving away from the oil industry.\n\nMy wife and I both work for an O&amp;G company. I can't vote for a guy who has made a statement that he's going to actively pursue cutting of my livelihood, especially when given what I know about how energy is produced, it would so incredibly damaging to our economy to even attempt, and the chances of success are so small unless you get into an incredible amount of government over-reach, but that's a conversation that is its own ball of worms that I would assume is a discussion no one wants to have.\n\nI read a lot of things that suggested that obviously Biden couldn't accomplish that, and that no one should really be worried he's going to kill the O&amp;G industry (even though he said he would), but it just signaled to me that he was saying something that he didn't even think. He was bowing to his left-leaning base, who are also responsible for the rhetoric I've been talking about, the identity politics, the critical race theory, etc. \n\nSo yeah when my wife and I saw that we realized it would be a mistake to vote for him. I don't know what she *actually* did obviously, but I voted for Trump.\n\nIronic that white men like me were the only 'identity group' that decreased our support for Trump, and that is likely the reason Biden won. biden campaign understand popularity minorities thought remotely surprising actually ready"}

No offense, I respect your opinions and anybody's opinions, but a lot of this can be described as mainstream garbage and/or contain a lot of tropes that turn people off of anime for being too weird/different.\n\nI would never seriously recommend No Game No Life to somebody not already into anime (just based on my tastes, I wouldn't ever, but depending on the person maybe). Nor Kyokou Suiri and Inu X Boku SS. Too echi, too much lowbrow humor. They are rather for people with very specific tastes.\n\nElfen Lied it's a pretty shallow horror series. Gore for the sake of gore, tragedy that poorly tries to aim for hitting emotional beats. Kind of similar to Made in Abyss, in that sense. Would leave most people with a bad impression of the medium, I think.\n\nAttack on Titan is great, but it's not a great adaptation. The manga would be a better experience.\n\nSteins;Gate is wonderful, as an adaptation is probably one of the best. But the VN is still significantly better. I would recommend the anime still, however, for people who want to experience the story in a much less time-consuming way. Visual novels aren't for everybody.\n\nClannad is a moeblob anime that, well, yes, it is an emotional experience, but not a earned one. I wouldn't describe any of the characters as well-developed.  People get emotional with the series because of the general sadness of the events, the excellent work of the voice actors and the soundtrack more than anything else. When I first watched it, I was ready to give it a 5/5 but, looking back on it, it was missing too many important things.\n\nCan't comment on Baccano, cause I haven't seen it.\n\nI second Onepunch-man and Lain.

Ask your doctor about propranalol medication, they don't affect your brain or anything so theyre pretty harmless, they only slow down the physical symptoms.

Pitbull is an umbrella term for dogs with similar LOOKS so knowing that we can go into these statistics and look at some specific breeds, were the dogs mixed (often times pitbull mixes tend to have the classic pitbull look) and so on. Nurture when it comes to animals is a VERY significant part of what makes their behavior. Something as simple as taking a puppy away from mom and sibling before 8 weeks can have an effect. Again we come around to the umbrella term pitbull. If pitbull refers to several different breeds, let's look at what those breeds were made for, the American Staffordshire is a classic example of the pitbull looking dog and yet was bred for companionship for FAMILIES. News companies do like to put put the most horrific stories of Pitbull type dogs because they get the most views, usually do to the severe misunderstanding of these dogs. They also dont do a lot of research on the specifics of these dogs.

I think the big issue that is common to both racists and overly sensitive trying to be woke white people is that they don't actually know any (or many) non-white people.

And so what both extremes end up doing is basically treating black people as more of an idea - they have their own pre-conceived ideas about black people and end up accordingly treating them more as an abstract collective rather than individuals. It's just that in one case those ideas and assumptions are more outwardly negative than the other, but in both cases it's a form of racism.\n\nIn a weird way, I think a lot of trying to be woke white people are more afraid of black people than the outward racists.

Pre-eminent among these was Nelson Rockefeller, whose mother had co-founded the Museum of Modern Art in New York. As president of what he called \"Mummy's museum\", Rockefeller was one of the biggest backers of Abstract Expressionism (which he called \"free enterprise painting\"). His museum was contracted to the Congress for Cultural Freedom to organise and curate most of its important art shows.\n\nThe museum was also linked to the CIA by several other bridges. William Paley, the president of CBS broadcasting and a founding father of the CIA, sat on the members' board of the museum's International Programme. John Hay Whitney, who had served in the agency's wartime predecessor, the OSS, was its chairman. And Tom Braden, first chief of the CIA's International Organisations Division, was executive secretary of the museum in 1949.\"\n\nI don't want to put my tinfoil hat, but the Rockefeller helped this way more than I'd like. museum rockefeller father cia paley president chairman tom abstract expressionism"}

{"docid": 369792, "augmented_text": "What do you think about there being a “good” or a “bad” time to break up with somebody? You haven't said why it is you're thinking of breaking up with them, so it's hard to give specific advice. That said, as a general principle, if you do have good reasons for ending the relationship and want to, you should, even if the other person isn't in the best of circumstances.\n\nWhen I was a little older than you, I was in a very similar situation, dating a girl who met most of the criteria you listed here, and then some. Like you, I kept thinking, \"I know she doesn't seem to be into me, and I'm not happy in this relationship, but this isn't a good time, I need to keep this going until she reaches a better place in life.\" And so I kept prolonging the inevitable for quite a while, until I finally realized that I was absolutely miserable and being treated pretty badly. I went and met with her and told her this was not going to work. Turns out, she was planning to ghost me when she left for a summer study abroad while letting me think we were still dating. (Yes, she explicitly said that, almost verbatim, and then refused to apologize.) And that's when I realized that I should have ended that *way* before I actually did, and that she'd basically just been using me the whole time to have some company since no one else could stand her.\n\nSure enough, years after, she was still (as far as I could tell from a distance) in a constant state of crisis. Some of it was just that she hadn't been dealt the best hand in life, and some of it was that she was and is a very emotionally immature person who doesn't know how to handle life's difficulties in a healthy and normal way. But the point is, there would never have been a \"good\" time to end that relationship. Waiting some arbitrary length of time was incredibly stupid, and if I had it to do over again, I would dump her ass the first time I realized she didn't really like me and was just playing me.\n\nWith all that said...your partner doesn't own you. Your life is your own. If you have good reasons for ending the relationship, then end it and move on. Unless there's some kind of extreme, worst-case scenario thing going on right now like their parents killing themselves or something horrible like that, you shouldn't hesitate because his life isn't going great. The traits you described - bad family, bad job, no ambition, bad finances, etc. - are not temporary things that might go away in a few months. Those things may last a very long time, and when they come together in clusters, it's sadly sometimes the case that people *never* emerge from toxic combinations of bad life factors.\n\nThe last thing: you're 20. You may feel like an adult, and legally speaking you are, but you're way too young to be worried about whether you're screwing up The Relationship Of Your Life. If you were in a years long serious relationship at 38, I'd be more inclined to advise caution, but at 20, just go with your gut. ending relationship thinking breaking planning ghost life factors study abroad"}

So many ways a new home owner can get the shaft.\n\nDON'T LET THEM STAMPEDE YOU INTO BUYING.  It's OK to do a quick purchase once you've done enough homework that you know what to look for.\n\nThe realtor(s) and anyone they employ are working for the seller.  It is NOT in their best interest for you to get it at the lowest possible price.\n\nYou'll be poor the first 6 months trying to buy all the accessories/equipment/furniture that most apartment dwellers don't need.\n\nMaintenance, maintenance, maintenance.  You'll always be fixing/upgrading things.  JUST DOESN'T STOP.\n\nDon't sweat the small things.  Anything that has been painted will probably get painted over within the first year.  Concentrate on the structural/mechanical/landscaping health of the property. Pay a LOT of attention to the roof and any signs of leaks.  NEVER BUY A PROPERTY WITH A FLAT OR LOW PITCH ROOF.  Does the landscaping funnel the water away from your house and the neighbor's house?  Look for cracks/repairs in walls/floors/foundations. Hairline cracks are inevitable in concrete/masonry.  1/4\" gaps are not.\n\nHIRE YOUR OWN INSPECTION TEAM.  1) If they are working for someone else then they don't have your best interests at heart.  2) CYA is a very big problem with inspectors.  If they point out a big ticket item then get a specialist in to double check it.\n\nGet title insurance.  Make sure it covers property line issues. \n\nTalk to the neighbors on all sides.

I was kind of more of a laid back drinker, she wanted to go out every night. We would have assignments due and I would be at home working on them while she is at the \"club\". Anyways, we grow distant and are barely even hanging out anymore, also at this point I am pretty sure she is cheating on me.\n\nI go to her place one day just to go and grab anything that I have over there, before I leave she says that she wants to talk about us. She says that she still wants to be together but she feels that she has the right to live out the college life (partying, drinking and what not). I tell her that she is free to do what she wants, but I also have the right not be with her anymore, so I just grab my stuff and leave. Anyways fast forward a couple months and she flunked out after the first semester.\n\nI ended up going to University after college and I would see first year students do it all the time. They get it in their head that they can do that sort of romanticized partying in post-secondary all the time and end up flunking out rather quickly.

{"docid": 413080, "augmented_text": "What was the most unbelievable scene of events that you personally witnessed? Very violent and disturbing content ahead. \n\nI broke up with ex 3 months ago. About 2 months later, I moved out into a new apartment. I did not tell him the address. \n\nLast month, I woke up in the middle of the night to my ex hitting and choking new bf, who had been sleeping next to me. I pleaded with ex to stop, and didn't try to engage physically bc I knew he was much stronger than me and about 80+ pounds heavier. I could hear gurgling sounds - bf's blood in his throat. There was so much blood, even from what little i could see from the light of the moon and streetlamps outside. Bf kicked ex off of him and I reached for my phone to call the police.\n\nEx knocked the phone out of my hand and I lunged for it. He held me back by the ankle. A struggle ensued and ex was holding me down. Bf got him in a chokehold and said \"let her go.\" Ex put his arm around my own neck and said, \"if you hurt me, I hurt her.\"\n\nBf said, \"let's just talk. Count of 3 we let go and get up and talk.\" Ex, realizing he was compromised, agreed. \n\nBf: nice punch btw \n\nEx: thanks. You fought good too. [[I dont remember exactly what they said here but I just remember being flabbergasted as bf tried to play it cool and laugh it off/defuse the situation]]\n\nMe: please just leave so I can call an ambulance \n\nEx: how do I know you won't call the police? \n\nMe: I promise not to if you just leave right now. Hes bleeding so much I just want an ambulance\n\nBf: why are you doing this? What was your plan? \n\nEx: I was going to kill you, kill her, and then kill myself \n\nBf: it doesn't have to be like this. Leave and we'll just pretend this didn't happen \n\nEx: you know that's not true. They'll catch me and ill be in prison and my life will be over \n\nBf: you can plead insanity and get a lighter sentence. Get help\n\nEx: there's no way out of this. How am I going to get out of here? [[Ex did not have a car. Im guessing he got there via rideshare]] \n\nBf: just take my car then.\n\nEventually ex agreed to leave then in exchange for me being able to call the ambulance. I rushed downstairs and searched for bf's car keys, then gave him the keys and escorted him to the car. As soon as he got in the car, I ran back inside and called an ambulance. \n\nBf was very calm, saying don't worry, ill be ok, but I was panicking hard. He needed extensive surgery - neither of us had noticed in the dark, but ex had stabbed him with a large kitchen knife. The tip of the knife broke off and lodged into his skull, touching his brain. Mentally, he is totally fine - i was amazed to discover that he had talked my ex out of a murder-suicide with such severe injuries. \n\nBf's other major injuries were a deep scar to one side of his face and all the tendons severed in one arm. He has about 6 months of physical therapy ahead of him but doctors think he will make a full recovery. \n\nAll crazy stuff, but what stood out as unbelievable to me: \n\n1. Bf being so coherent and speaking normally with a 1-inch piece of knife stuck in his head\n2. Ex, who said he had been raised to reign in his anger, losing control like that. He emphasized how his parents were very strict with him on it, and how he was raised to  talk things out calmly and not even raise his voice so as to not seem intimidating\n3. Ex breaking through the door to get into the apartment - the door was locked with a metal chain attached to the door frame. He pushed through the door so hard that the frame popped out. \n4. Ex did not have any history of homicidal behavior or thoughts that I knew of (i know he had attempted suicide in the past) \n5. Ex promised that he would never hurt me. That night, he had been determined to kill me. \n6. We actually convinced ex to leave us alone. Ex had really snapped to do something so awful, but he was still capable of logical thought. He was not blinded by anger. He had made a detailed plan to do those violent acts. witnessed violent unbelievable bf ambulance ex throat blood streetlamps outside"}

So here's the story of how I nearly drowned after undressing my boss:\n\nIt was 2016, on the island Krk, Croatia. My dad was in a rather complicated situation. He had a workshop on nude and bikini beach photography coming up, with participants from all over europe, but the models had cancelled last minute. He desperately had to find someone willing to undress in front of the camera, so he made a facebook post, claiming that he was even willing to accept amateurs this time and that he'd pay more than usual.\n\nHe got messaged by a young artist willing to do something like this, even though she had never done it before, they both agreed and she showed up at my dads studio shortly after in a beat-up old citroen xm in neon blue. She drove there with us and I talked to her during the 6 hours drive. We found out that we actually already had seen each other before, we both used to do horseback riding at the same stable.\n\nDuring the trip, I turned into her personal assistent of some sorts, helping her dress/undress quickly, bringing her water etc. One day I was once again asked to help her undress. The problem was that she was posing on a rock in the middle of the ocean. So i balanced and jumped on several rocks until I reached the one she was chilling on, helped her out of her outfit and then tried to go back again, this time carrying the huge ballgown she had worn earlier. I tripped on the gown and fell into the ocean. I got entangled in the long dress and panicked, seriously, scariest experience ever. One of my dad's colleagues jumped into the ocean to get me out, but forgot to put down his camera. He was desperately trying to pull me out using one arm while holding his Nikon above the surface using the other. Another photographer then pulled both of us out of the water. It was absolutely freezing and I spent the rest of the time sick in my hotel room.\n\nMe and the model kind of lost contact again after that. Three years later, I decided to get a side job as an artist at a new gallery in town, which actually belongs to the model. So I can now proudly say that I have seen my hot boss naked. porn photographers undressing boss experience dad awkward moment horseback riding"}

By looking at what goes around us and seeing the beauty in ordinary things, we all can find that little bit more happiness. The beauty of a your office space, the beauty of the person driving or the car next to you in traffic, the beauty of a the plants and the sound they make when the wind comes. \nI find watching this movie acts as a good way to ‘hard reset’ my thoughts when I’m feeling low, and realise that while life does suck, it can always be seen in a different light.

{"docid": 474567, "augmented_text": "Assuming all attempts to create a vaccine have failed and the only course of action is to abandon the earth for other planets, what should our next course of action be? You don’t understand how far away even the closest planets are, so you? The only other planet in our own solar system that is even remotely potentially habitable is Mars, and that potential is very limited. Scientists have speculated about terraforming Mars, but the ideas are pretty pie in the sky and would take decades at a minimum. Even then it’s quite likely that Mars simply doesn’t have enough gravity to hold a breathable atmosphere. So we have to look somewhere else. What about another sun? What would that trip take? Voyager is the only man made object to have actually left our solar system (probably, depending on who you ask) and it’s hasn’t even made it to the sidewalk in front of the house in galactic terms. It’s moving at something like 17 miles/second and it’s taken it something like 40 years to get that far. For the record, light speed is just a little shy of 300 million miles a second. The nearest star to us is Proxima Centauri. It’s about 4.25 light YEARS away from us. The fastest man made object in space is a solar probe which whips around the sun at around 215k mph, about 60 m/sec. The Juno probe zooms around Jupiter going as much as 130k mph, at touch above 36 m/sec. (Fun fact: a nuclear test back in the late 50s is estimated to have shot a large metal disc into the sky at upwards of 125k mph. That’s kind of an estimate because, surprisingly, they never found it and aren’t sure what happened to it, but I digress...) My point is that we are a very long way away from being able to reach another planet that we could resettle; not just by distance but by the technology needed to make it even remotely possible. It would take us generations of traveling through interstellar space to reach even the closest star systems to our own, and we would have no promises that what we found there would be suitable. Everything in that last sentence is also hugely simplified by the way. That’s all supposition ignoring immense hurdles to making it possible. Generations in space, traveling through deep space, finding a planet that’s immediately suitable: all those things are hugely problematic on their own. Keep in mind that the oxygen we need to breath isn’t “naturally” in our atmosphere. It wasn’t until early single celled organisms started consuming carbon dioxide and burping out oxygen as a side effect that, after millions of years, the air started to resemble something like what we have now. It’s entirely possible that life is needed to create an oxygenated atmosphere. The odds of finding a planet that’s is move-in ready with breathable air and drinkable water and soil that has the nutrients we’d need to grow crops and temperatures that aren’t too hot or too cold AND is close enough to us that it would possible to get to in an amount of time that wasn’t in the hundreds of years is, sad to say, very small. None of this even touches on the issue of building ships that could take even a tiny proportion of the people on this planet anywhere. That’s a whole different rant for another time. voyager closest star create vaccine terraforming mars action abandon"}

Some sedimentary rocks, like shale, are black due to their high organic content which breaks down at high pressure/temperature.\n\nYou can tell this rock is metamorphic due to the veins and mineral textures.\n\nFor reference, the three rock types are;\n\nigneous - form directly for molten material\n\nsedimentary - formed of transported material or chemically precipitated.\n\nmetamorphic - any type of rock that has later been significantly altered in some way (heat, pressure, water chemistry, etc) igneous rock shale black dark colour indicates mafic problem printer"}

Humans have existed for a mere blip on this planet. And most of the universe will consist of just black holes and nothingness. I'm not being doom and gloom, but I have never been convinced of the idea that this universe was \"designed\" for us.\n\nAlso, most importantly, if there was a designer, I have had a thought experiment for some time that I cannot get beyond: Could this designer make the mass of an electron heavier than a proton, and still have this universe as a result?

{"docid": 541506, "augmented_text": "What's a life hack that sounds crappy but actually works really well? Let's talk about context switching. This is where you quit paying attention to what you're doing and pay attention to something totally different. You can switch back to the original thing of course but that's two context switches. Mind you this also doesn't full on match the original context; you'll be creating an entirely new context but it will relate to the stuff before.\n\nYour brain can't pay attention to things for hours at a time. We just aren't wired that way; this is why if you cram hard you can't seem to remember anything on test day. Your brain actually has an arc where it will remember the first things and the last things you looked at but forget everything in the middle. This is usually about 20 minutes but it varies by person. If it's 20 minutes you'll remember the first and last 10 minutes even if you pay attention to the same thing for 10 hours.\n\nSo when you're trying to learn something or study don't hyperfocus; let yourself context switch your brain every 20 minutes or so. Again this varies so you'll need to test how long your attention span is. If you constantly find yourself only remembering 15 minutes of work then yours is 15 minutes. Now, mind that this doesn't need to be full on doing something else for whatever the time span is. It can be something as quick as looking up a word in the dictionary and reading the definition. The point is to derail your train of thought so your brain resets its context.\n\nIncidentally this also works when you're working on some kind of cognitive task. For example every programmer has a story where they fought with a bug all god damned day fucking hell why can't I fix this only to have the solution hit them like a ton of bricks when they got up to get a cup of coffee. It's precisely the same mechanism in play; the context switch forced your brain off of its track so it could then go back to the original context but with that reset. context switching remember test attention things life hack doing time"}

Especially when you're in your twenties and thirties, and just trying to make a career for yourself. Having a partner means that you missed out on a lot of spontaneous growth.

Hunger games styles with natural elements and resource gather I'd say any weapon that which requires setup is useless when used when its not ready or can't be triggered i.e: a trap wont help if you're fighting no where near it, or a bow/gun is useless if it isnt loaded. Same idea goes for bar fight scenarios of  and spontaneous close quarters.\n\nIn any form of royale any weapon that completely inferior to any given weapons is useless. For instance if everyone is giving a gun by default (like real war) and everyone already has a proper melee like a knife, then any improv weapon like a brick or a big stick is virtually useless while that could be the defining factor if you're an unarmed civilian in warzone with rubble n shit.\n\nAny royale that happens in a short time frame or where you don't need food/water stuff like poison that requires to be ingested in useless, but could be useful in other types of royales.\n\nI'm sure i can think and ponder all day more stuff, it actually a really interesting question, but to wrap it up I'd assume in any royale you get to prepare like hunger games you'll have this figured out beforehand cause you know the type of stuff thats available to some degree. In a spontaneous fight like a bar scene you probably wont have to much time to figure out which weapon is gonna be viable or not when you need to grab the closest thing, so i guess just take note of whats around you  that could inflict fatal damage to your adversaries where ever you go :D weapons useless types royales knife improv bar fight like hunger"}

Eventually got to a point where sleep wasn't doing much of anything, and I'd wake up with headaches and all. Doctor I went to recommended that I go see a therapist, as well as regulate my diet better. Unhealthy eating habits plus all the stress and anxiety that came with having to constantly juggle work and school simply just cowed my body into submission, as it were. \n\nObviously can't say that I had the exact same problem as you are currently having, but yeah, do try to see a doctor.

Not enough money to put gas in the tank, since we were hovering around $5 a gallon in Maryland at the time. So I parked in a lot that had a Walmart, a gym, and a pizza joint. Worked at the pizza place, showered at the gym because membership was only $15 a month, and bought lunch meat and bread from the Walmart. It was miserable, the absolute worst time in my life, and I hope you don't suffer through that. We absolutely need to do better as a society lifting people out of those situations. And I don't think owning a nice phone or home internet has anything to do with that.\n\nBut I never said anything about living in your car until you brought it up out of the blue. We were talking about forgoing a nice smart phone and internet service in your own home, not being homeless.

It was actually at urgent care. He was patient, answered all of my questions, and didn't rush me. MY OBGYN for my 1st pregnancy (who would have turned into my PCP) was horrific, and I switched practices to a midwifery, which is now my PCP. They're technically specialists, but as far as women's health care goes, they can do anything. They listened, explained things, and were AMAZING. The difference that has been consistent through all of my health care providers was that the MDs were pretty arrogant, and tended to rush through things (except for my ER experience, he was the best possible person to be with me in that moment). Try and get an NP, they have a much better bedside manner, since they're trained as nurses first. A PA is good too. providers mds midwifery pcp visit gp obgyn 1st horrific cold"}

One of his rules that stuck out the most to me was that you *never* loan money to friends. It's better to gift it to them, even though that may be harmful to you.\n\nIf you loan money to a friend, that will separate you. You will gradually take power, and they will recede into a servant role. No matter how small this change is, the fact that it's present is enough to destroy a friendship. And friendships are invaluable.\nIf you're also financially tight, just don't loan the money. If your friend doesn't understand, which is very unfortunate, then it's better that they feel hurt temporarily than the death of your relationship. But most people (especially good friends) are sensible, and they'll understand if you're financially restricted.\n\nI realize that I'm not answering your question, but I think it's relevant to the topic and should be heard nonetheless. money friends harmful loan better gift dating woman management advice"}

{"docid": 710606, "augmented_text": "Redditors who work at remote places like forest officers, oil rig workers, etc, what creepy things have you noticed while at work? Hiking with a gun is usually a bad idea. If a bear is already charging before you recognize the danger and pull out the gun, then it's already too late, and if you're hiking with the gun in your hands or holstered so that you're always ready then you're kinda killing the mood for other hikers who may be put off by guns.\n\nNot only that, but responsible gun owners never ever leave their gun unattended and unsecured. This means, if you're hiking with it, you sleep with it, you shit with it, you chop wood with it, you never leave it unattended. If you want to go swimming in a lake or river, and you leave your expensive gun on the shore, and someone walks by and takes it, then not only are you in danger, you're partially liable for whatever they do with it.\n\nIf you absolutely must hike with a gun, the modern lineup of CZ pistols are lightweight and very good, same with FN. If killing a bear is on your feature list then the only things that will do that reliably are the . 44 magnum cartridge (and up) and *maybe* cartridges like 45ACP or FN5.7mm. hiking gun bear charging guns responsible takes danger leave unattended"}

I did my graduate research at an old railway work camp from the early 1900s. It was about a 20 minute hike into the hills from the decommissioned rail line, and I made this hike every day for 8 weeks one summer. \n One morning I was joined by my graduate supervisor and the two of us were hiking up the trail together. We came around a corner and about 20ft off of the trail to our right was a mama black bear and two cubs. They were known to be in the area, but I hadn’t seen any sign of them until that day. We stopped in our tracks and as she saw us she stood up on her hind legs watching us. So the two of us began backing our way slowly down the way we had come hoping she wouldn’t approach us. As luck would have it she wanted nothing to do with us and we made our way back to the railway line and out to our truck. \n\nNeedless to say research was postponed that day. workers creepy black bear 20ft trail hadn seen research postponed"}

{"docid": 722988, "augmented_text": "Redditors who work at remote places like forest officers, oil rig workers, etc, what creepy things have you noticed while at work? I was in southeast Alaska for around 15 days a few summers ago. We had just finished up dinner and washed out our pots and pans and gone to our respective tents in the trees along the shore we had stopped at for the night. The spot we had chosen to camp wasn't ideal. The tide was set to come in pretty far that night and it would only leave us with a few feet before the water would be lapping at our tent flaps. But we also didn't care that much as it had been raining and incredibly windy that day so kayaking was hardly any fun at all and we needed to stop. About 45 minutes after we had said goodnight to one another I heard some splashing in the tidal zone, probably 20 feet from my tent. I didn't think much of it because a few times before when in Alaska we had stopped at beaches where the tide had risen to within a few feet of our tents. Anyway, I try to ignore it, although in my mind I'm freaking the fuck out. Our camp spot was less than ideal if you wanted to escape in the middle of the night. We were at the base of a relatively steep hill that was covered in alders and slick with rain, to the left, probably 70 feet from where we camped there was a rocky outcrop that went out into the water and was about 20 feet tall and steep enough that you couldn't climb it. If, for example, a grizzly bear (and there were a lot out that time of the summer, we had seen 4 or 5 that day alone, patrolling the beaches) wanted to see what was going on down the beach and walked towards us from the right it would basically seal off our movement. Sort of like putting the cork back in the wine bottle, not many places to go. Anyway, after 15 minutes of hearing splashing I start to try to rationalize it enough to go to sleep. But that's when I start hearing something other than splashing. This incredibly high pitched gargling sound breaks through the night's relative quiet. It sounded as though two cats had gotten into a fight but every time they let out a scream the other cat would push the one cats head underwater. This went on for a good twenty minutes. After it died down I hear \"that's weird huh?\" from the other tent, obviously trying to downplay the incident. I, being scared as fuck, just reply \"yep, going to sleep!\" Another 15 minutes pass without much sound, but then the same gargling breaks through the night, this time much much closer. The noises are deeper this time, more guttural. It sounds like an old man fighting with a cat, and each time either of them shriek they are forced underwater, the splashing intensifies and it sounds like it's right outside my tent. I think that the fear of whatever was going on eventually just zapped me of all energy because eventually i fell asleep. I just remember that I didn't move a muscle, and i didn't move for so long that all of my muscles ached after awhile and I could feel my heart beat in my throat all night long. Anyway, we woke up, had breakfast, broke down the tents and got back on the road. Didn't hear it ever again. A few weeks later I did some googling and I'm pretty sure that it was just some sea otters fighting each other in the intertidal zone. But it was scary as fuck. I'll link the youtube audio of the noises if I can find it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: They were seals fighting, not sea otters, here's the audio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L\\_UKEU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L_UKEU) Imagine hearing this as you lie in the cold dark in the middle of nowhere scared that a grizzly might come down the beach and eat you.\n\nTLDR: Lying in the dark in Alaska and hear guttural screams and what sounds like someone being drowned, in the pitch black in the middle of nowhere, 20 feet outside of my tent. beaches tide outside tent kayaking workers creepy alaska stopped"}

When your partner has affairs...\n\nWhen your partner has you quit your job and all of you move to another state... so she can divorce you as she couldn't work in the state you'd been in but she could work (teach) in the state you moved to.  She'd been a stay at home mom since we had our 3 children and she couldn't teach in our state with her license the way it was but she could teach in that other state.\n\nShe went off to be with \"girlfriends\" on many weekends before we moved and after we moved to that new state and of course it was to be with her paramour, I just didn't know that yet.\n\nShe took our 3 children off to his state and spent a weekend with him.\n\nI didn't want to divorce, I was trying to keep us all together. \n\nSince we'd moved to another state, we were living in a rented 3 bedroom home and our home in our other state hadn't sold yet.\n\nI came home from work one night and my wife said \"let's go\" and I asked her where and she told me to look for places for move to move into as she wanted me out.\n\nShe'd already contacted our landlord (of the 3 bedroom house we were renting) and arranged for her to show us places that evening, I just had no idea until I got home.\n\nSo, my wife was taking the lead to push me out.\n\nAfter I'd moved out, I came home from work one night to find lots of my things sitting outside in the grass in the yard, for anyone to take.

They’re going to understand that you didn’t deserve it. And they’re going to feel guilty. It’s really going to hurt them, but they will completely understand your decision on how to deal with it. They would be committed to fixing things no matter what. IMO I wouldn’t leave them, because they were open and honest with you. If they genuinely are putting effort into fixing it and making it right then I would hold them to that promise. But if it’s an unhealthy relationship with a lot of fighting and yelling, there’s no trust, no accountability, a lot of secrets, etc. Then yes they will continue to do it until it drives both of you apart. They will hide it from you and lie about it when you ask them. They will blame you for not making it easy for them. They’ll become bored of you and turn it into a game.

{"docid": 795657, "augmented_text": "Truck drivers, what's a creepy story you've got from the middle of nowhere? It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.\n\nThat said.\n\nIn 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.\n\nAn IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.\n\nMy mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.\n\nI'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\n\nI have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.\n\nPsychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.\n\nI'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.\n\nI don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.\n\nI believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n\nI don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.\n\nI love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.\n\nI'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.\n\nThe only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.\n\nI consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.\n\nThat doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).\n\nI'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).\n\nAnd, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.\n\nAll that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me? iq test advice support age judgmental drivers creepy understanding thermodynamics"}

Engine would be strapped to a rail car and moved to the test site for firing.  Test site would be very radioactive because the firey rocket exhaust from it was just compressed air they would blast from an array of tanks into it, over the operational, insulated reactor.  One of the proposals for it in operation actually involved flying it in circles at low altitude over enemy territory to kill them with the combination of its sonic boom and radioactive exhaust.\n\n If you can talk about it, when we're you there?

I can elaborate more of what I have heard throughout the years after I sleep if anyone cares.\n\nEdit for story time, and sorry it took so long!!!\n\nOk, so for anyone who has followed me for awhile they know I spent 10+ in the military and have been a tattoo artist for 11 years now. Been to Japan (they have a version of bigfoot), to Afghanistan (also bigfoot), Kuwait (bigfoot), and others.\n\nIn my travels I have met and tattooed well over 6,000 people, and to for anyone who doesn’t get tattooed, it is kind of like therapy. People get them for all different reasons, but the common theme is that people like to talk. I try to have friendly conversation with all my clients, but if anything sounds too crazy I tend to just nod my head and carry on with the tattoo.\n\nNow that the basics are covered; I will never forget these 5 particular clients I had while tattooing in southern Arizona. 2 truckers and 3 welders to tie in 2 ridiculous sounding conspiracy theories that I may or may not fully believe... but these got me listening.\n\nStarting with the welders, on 3 seperate occassions I tattooed union types who claimed to be on a massive government contract, whose sole purpose was welding shackles into cattle cars. I tattooed them for about 6 months and they showed me pictures and video... said that for 10 hours a day they fitted cattle cars with chains and shackles. That was nearly a decade ago, so take it as you will. No one has been rounded up yet.\n\nThe most fascinating 2 clients, with the coolest stories though, were these 2 truckers. Tattooed them every time they were in town. The first, let’s call him Jim, said he worked for a government contracted shipping company and all his work entailed was driving cargo into the mountains, driving past military checkpoints, into a circular door cut into the mountain, and dropping the cargo off into a staging area tall enough to park a small skyscraper. Jim said he saw huge tunnels leading off of this chamber, and trucks coming and going with cargo, but his clearance let him into the staging area to unload and then leave, no more.\n\nSo, needless to say I was skeptical. Like, yea, I worked for the alphabet soup and know all about some of the mountain retreats and missle silos, but really, underground highways? Staging areas you can walk a mecha through? Quit pulling my chain...\n\nThat was until about 2-3 months later when I met Bill. Bill said he was a trucker and when I asked what he carried he said all the secret cargo. I asked him, “so like all the covered stuff you see on the highway”, and his reply was just ; no, the stuff too dangerous or off the books that you never see it on the highway. Since the thoughts of Jim’s stories were still in my mind, I asked if he meant the underground highway and Bill lit up like crazy. Like he was tired of having his work discounted. He went of for the entire session about the crazy weapons and biohazard shit he hauled around on, “the great American underground highway”; his words.\n\nAs Bill explained it, and corroborated Jim’s story, the underground drivers are different from the aboveground so as maintain seperation and levels of secrecy. All the doors are guarded by blackop types and the scale is simply off the charts. He said that the entire nation was connected underground via these tunnels, but only near major cities were there access points; and those were usually hidden in the mountains. Just thousands of miles of giant tunnels deep underground being driven soley by government contract truckers hauling ultra sensative gear.\n\nI don’t know how true these stories are because I have never seen them, nor can I provide any proof; but 2 strangers sharing a similar story definitely makes your stop and pause.

Before he really knows how to react the car pulls off at the next exit and my dad, although shaken, carries on. \nAbout half an hour later a different car with a different driver pulls alongside my dad, with the same woman in the passenger seat, with the same expression on her face. My dad thinks ‘fuck this’ and plans to pull into the next services to report as even if it’s nothing / misunderstanding, better to be safe than sorry, right? Anyway the car disappears before he can get any details (plates etc) and he thinks there is no point calling the police with no details so he carries on driving. \nLiterally about 4 hours later, almost in London,  yet another car pulls alongside him with the same woman, same miss trunchbull hair, same terrified expression, except this time she appears to be SCREAMING at my dad through the window, so my dad pulls over into a layby and calls the police. Apparently they have received 3 other calls about the same woman / car in the same area in the last few minutes.

Then when I finally escaped I started making something out of myself and really feeling fulfilled and okay- I experienced a missile threat which pushed me over the edge into developing ptsd. \n\nI think a lot of the self hate comes from hearing and believing everything my abusers have said to me. Then a lot of self hate comes from shame I feel about developing ptsd over something that a lot of people experience and DONT get ptsd from. I feel shamed and self hate that I am on disability and I think my family thinks I don’t deserve to be or that what I experienced wasn’t “that bad”. \nAnd then a lot of the reason I hate living in my body/mind is because of the disgusting memories and images I have in my mind from my childhood sexual abuse.

They also have a false compartment to boot. \n\nOctopuses have a donut shaped brain that surrounds their \"oesophagus\" meaning that if they swallow something too big they may get brain damage, though they technically have a brain in each tentacle. Oh, and they also have three hearts. \n\nWhen it comes to humans though? Your eyes **ARE YOUR BRAIN**, they are literally a part of your brain.

This story is apocryphal and likely several cats were involved (Tibbles was pregnant, and had had kittens by the time she was brought to the island, eventually covering the place with feral cats), but I'm going to tell it to you the way it was told to me. \n\nTibbles the cat may very well be the only organism with the dubious distinction of having caused the extinction of an entire species. The Lyall's Wren was a small, flightless songbird native to New Zealand. After rats wiped it out on the main islands, its final refuge was a small rock called Stephens Island, in the Cook Strait. In 1879, the British government decided to build a lighthouse on the island. Its first keeper arrives in 1894, and brings with him a house cat named Tibbles. Tibbles quickly realizes that flightless songbirds are easy and fun to kill, and begins to murder them in droves. She takes dozens and dozens of the birds every day. The lighthouse keeper, Rothschild, quickly realizes that at the current kill rates the birds will die out. Instead of, you know, putting a bell on Tibbles or keeping her indoors, he takes advantage of the situation and starts to pickle and sell the bird corpses, making serous money because bird collectors are very interested in owning the body of an animal that will soon be extinct (same reason why the last two breeding great auks were killed, fyi - poachers wanted their eggs to sell to collectors, who paid incredible amounts of money for something that was now no longer alive in the world. Hell, elephant ivory is only getting more valuable, driving more illegal poaching, for the same damn reason). By February of 1895, as predicted, the bird was extinct, all thanks to one cat named Tibbles and her thirst for blood. bird extinct biggest dick island keeper tibbles quickly build lighthouse"}

In US you pay less tax but can get a better private healthcare. Which is better and why? I think it's easy to argue Americans have less choice than other first world countries.\n\nAmericans pay an average of $7,184 in taxes towards healthcare. No choice in that. Then most have employer provided health insurance which averages [$6,896 for single coverage and $19,616 for family coverage](https://www.kff.org/report-section/2018-employer-health-benefits-survey-summary-of-findings/); little to no choice there without abandoning employer subsidies and paying the entire amount yourself. Furthermore these plans usually have significant limitations on where you can be seen. Need to actually go to the doctor? No choice but to pay high deductibles, copays, and other out of pocket expenses.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, take a Brit. They pay $3,138 average in taxes towards healthcare. He has the choice of deciding that is enough; unlike Americans who will likely have no coverage for the higher taxes they pay. But if he's not satisfied there are a wide variety of supplemental insurance programs. The average family plan runs [$1,868 per year](https://boughtbymany.com/news/article/private-health-insurance-cost-uk/), so it's quite affordable, and can give the freedom to see practically any doctor (public or private) with practically zero out of pocket costs.\n\nSo you tell me... who has more meaningful choices? taxes healthcare healthcare choice americans choice cost uk coverage higher"}

As we were chatting about nothing on a break, I ask him how things are now that he's moved back (cos he'd actually grown up in the area).  He said it's nice, but there's just so many \"fucking Mexicans now.\"  It really caught me off guard, and upset me personally cos my girlfriend is Puerto Rican.

Not only is his acting absolutely horrific, the entire film is just such a train wreck. \n\nIt feels too lighthearted and sentimental for a proper gangster film. It’s far too violent and dark to be a lighthearted sentimental movie. It almost touches on Tarantino-esque surrealist violence but yet tries to play it out seriously after the violence. The tone shifts so much back and forth that the resulting hodgepodge feels like 5 different movies. \n\nAlso, Baldwin’s protagonist, Ness, is meant to be seen as this Tom Hanks type straight lace, moral good guy fighting against corruption and injustice. However, he repeatedly goes way outside the bounds of the law to enforce his own brand of justice. He even pushes a murderer off a roof in cold blood, after capturing the guy. This would be fine if the film then dealt with his troubled morality, except at the end it tries to play it off as if he’s remained a stalwart good guy throughout. It’s almost as if the writer had amnesia and kept forgetting what he’d written and already filmed. \n\nThe quality of the film would’ve been somewhat more acceptable if the film had been a flop, but yet it received a shit ton of awards and critical praise. worst movie untouchables watched baldwin protagonist troubled morality proper gangster"}

OK, has anyone here seen the 1999 movie \"Starry Night\"?\n\nDoctor Who did a better treatment of Vincent van Gogh than this 101-minute mindless hodgepodge of a movie.\n\nIt starts with Vincent drinking a potato potion given him by his witch friend, Margot, who tells him that in 100 years, \"the flowers will bring \\[him\\] back\" for 100 days to set things right before the sea takes him home.\n\nIn \"Present Day\" (1990, given the date of his death), he appears with no explanation in the middle of the Rose Parade and is hit by a float. He is taken to the hospital where he meets a personal injury lawyer named Gabe.\n\nOther weird Vincent plot points:\n\n* He stops a mugging and becomes enamored of the victim (Kathy)\n* He paints a new Hollywood collection featuring the skyline and Hell's Angels\n* He seems to have the ability to break into the homes of people who have purchased his works without being detected\n* As such, he is presumed to be an art thief\n* He wants the royalties from all the purchases of his art to be put into a fund for the starving artists of the world\n* He embarrasses Kathy by correcting her professor about details of his life.\n* He interrupts an auction of one of his pieces\n* He ends up in jail and the shot of him (positioned inside the cell) talking to Kathy somehow ends up on the news that night.\n* SOMEHOW, he manages to get a passport and flies to France with Gabe (who he met in the hospital) and Kathy to find a set of paintings he had hidden in a cathedral (though he can't remember which one or where it is).\n\nThis is evidently supposed to be a comedy.

{"docid": 975861, "augmented_text": "What is the absolute worst movie you’ve ever seen? I’m not hating on your opinion but the reason I didn’t like the last Jedi was because it had bait and witches just because it wanted to.\n\nFor example at the end of the force awakens we had the big cliff hanger ending of seeing Luke Skywalker for the first time in like 40 or so years. We have this super dramatic scene of Rey being out Luke’s old lightsaber and and putting out her hand to give it to him and then all of a sudden like just grabs it and tosses it over his shoulder and just struts off. Literally like a scene that a high schooler would make as their parody of Star Wars.\n\nOf course some of the bait and switches were interesting like when Kylo Reb killed snoke and then Rey and Kylo kill those praetorian guards or whatever their called. But if you think about that scene, it made a whole character pointless. We had no background on snoke, a lot was hinted at what his backstory could possibly be and then guess what? We don’t get it. The brotha just does purely for shock value. Then we find out he’s just one of man clones that just look the way he does.\n\nAnother reason I wasn’t a fan of the last Jedi was because during serious scenes it didn’t seem to take it self seriously.\n\nFor example in the very beginning when the first order is firing down at the resistance base, Poe Dameron just flies up to the First order cruiser and then says a Yo momma joke to General Hux.\n\nIf the first order were such a finer experience military as they were made out to be all the way up to that point, then they would’ve just fuckin merked Poe the second he flew up to them.\n\nThe force awakens was an alright movie to start the new trilogy off with. The last Jedi was a bad sequel imo and of course the rise of sky leaker did the best it could with what it was given it still wasn’t very good.\n\nWhat sucks is I love the sequels but also hate them. The characters are interesting, the setting is interesting, the plot WAS interesting up until a certain but unfortunately the plot was the most important part and it failed IMO.\n\nI would love to see what it is about the last Jedi that make it your favorite. I don’t want to hate it. worst movie jedi bait seeing luke snoke rey make parody"}

So I offer up to pay for the her ticket.  \n\nThen we go to the concession stand.  I   had no income at that age, so I'm not interested in getting anything there.  However, she goes on a shopping spree.  Supersize popcorn, soda, non-perrels chocolate, gummy bears (for later!.. who buys food at the movies to take home for later?!)  I can't remember what else, but the bill was $45 and she says, \"Oh, I only have $5.\"\n\nSo basically by the time we were done, I spent $75 to go see this movie, and then I to add insult bto injury, I had to sit through Operation Dumbo fucking Drop...

{"docid": 982101, "augmented_text": "(Serious) Former addicts of reddit: what advice would you give to someone who wants to come clean but can't work up the courage to tell anyone? This is something I have a lot of experience with, but I can only give my experience so take from it what you may. I’m a pharmacist and back in the early 2000s got myself addicted to oxycodone. I hid it really well for a long time (about six years), but eventually life had become unmanageable. Despite suffering lots of consequences, and many unsuccessful attempts to curtail my use, my ego kept me from asking for help. To me there was a lot of shame wrapped up in admitting defeat and surrendering. What I failed to understand is that my secret was keeping me sick. I’ve heard addicts described as being egomaniacs with an inferiority complex, and that described me perfectly. All that shame made me try to seek relief in drugs which made me feel even more shameful. Obviously this is a devastating cycle. In my case I was fortunate enough to have an employer who one day gave me he ultimatum of checking myself into the hospital right now or they would call the police. Words cannot touch the sense of relief I felt at that moment- it was all being forced into the open. I quickly learned that if I wanted any chance of getting my life back I had to start getting honest, and that started with myself. Getting vulnerable and forcing a secret like that out into the open began the process of loosening the stranglehold addiction had on me. I had always believed that if people knew I was an addict they would think less of me, or be afraid of me, or any other number of things, but overwhelmingly I was embraced and met with grace and compassion. This is not to say that it was all rainbows and butterflies, I had hurt many people by lying to them- most notably my brothers. It has taken years to repair those relationships, but I can tell you they were not hurt by my drug use per se, but by the fact I lied to them so much and for so long. They could not believe that for seven years they had no idea I was an addict. I can’t change the past, but in my situation I could have saved tremendous heartache by reaching out and being honest. I’ve been clean for seven years now and hinge are better. Please DM me if you want to talk about anything. addicted oxycodone egomaniacs inferiority experience pharmacist reaching honest consequences unsuccessful"}
