He routinely failed to pay contractors and employees, made pathetically terrible attempts to diversify his business (Trump steaks?

He paid a C-tier pornstar $130,000 to have sex with him, and she described his penis as looking like the character Toad from Mario. Half the country hates his guts, as he didn’t even try to fulfill the president’s most important goal: uniting the country. He’s also barely able to speak English.

{"docid": 12493, "augmented_text": "What is a history fact that is so stupid it doesn't seem real? The date set for the Independence of India and transfer of power from the British to the Government of India was not a planned decision. Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, during a press event was asked by a reporter if a date was decided by him, to which he replied impromptu with 15th of August 1947. \n\nLater when Mountbatten was asked why he had chosen 15th August, he replied with the following:  “the date I chose came out of the blue. I chose it in reply to a question. I was determined to show I was master of the whole event. When they asked had we set a date, I knew it had to be soon. I hadn’t worked it out exactly then — I thought it had to be about August or September and I then went out to the 15th August. Why? Because it was the second anniversary of Japan’s surrender.” \n\nTo add on to the story, because Mountbatten hastily preponed the transfer, the British Raj called upon a cartographer who had no idea about India. He was put in charge of dividing India and Pakistan. There was no surveying of the place done, no studying of demographics done. The cartographer seemed to have drawn boundaries which suited his liking. This caused massive panic in India. An estimate of around 2 million people died post Partition in India as they had to literally shift countries and end up in alien place where they would restart their entire lives.\n\nThe boundaries drawn weren't logical yet the British Raj went with it. Today, this stupid boundary is the reason India and Pakistan have conflicts.\n\nThis may not sound as stupid as some of the other replies here, but when you account the magnitude of impact some stupid cartographer's map has had on the world, it sounds sadly stupid.\n\n(This post is for those who have no idea about the impact of the British Rule which extends to the modern day world) history fact set date august 1947 mountbatten asked india transfer"}

{"docid": 104983, "augmented_text": "What reasons cause so many women to demand so much from a relationship but offer very little? Now first off I want to say: NOT EVERY WOMAN IS LIKE THIS AT ALL. I had a very wonderful girlfriend that I’m going to make my fiancé who’s nothing like this, and have ex’s in the past who were nothing like this. HOWEVER, I believe that this can be stemmed from basically gender roles in the past. If you take a look at the past, well, pretty much all of history, males have been the breadwinner. In the caveman days, men would be the muscular ones to hunt and provide food. This goes all the way up really until WW2 when it stopped. Men were the ones to go to work, earn the money, pay the bills, while the wife tended the home. Considering this mainly only changed in WW2, where the men went to war and the women took over factories and many other workplaces. I’m in no way saying this is the way it should have been, it just was. With this, we still see a HUGE pressure on men to be the providers, to be making the living for their family. As a result, I would say it just provides that unconscious bias towards the idea that men should be the ones giving. In conclusion, gender roles still exist in today’s society, causing the underlying expectation for men to be the providers, in aspects other than just money. As this notion evidently carries on into many other roles. women demand provide food males breadwinner living family changed ww2"}

Dont expect her to lower her standards if you won't.\n3) she doesnt owe you anything\n4) nice isnt a personality, I had no personality, I was just generally agreeable.

Honestly I appreciate you asking.\n\nI was actually ready to vote for Biden this time around about a month ago, although I actually thought Trump would win. The election results were not remotely surprising to anyone on the right, to be honest. I'm actually surprised they weren't more off. I *was* surprised at the degree to which Trump did better with minorities. I thought he would do better, but not that much better.\n\nThe reason I was ready to vote for him is the same reason I'm hopeful about what he's been saying for the past week. His messaging seemed to be entirely focused on unity and stoping the vilification of our enemies. Biden's campaign, at the very least, seems to have picked up on exactly what my comment is about. It seemed like every Biden sponsored commercial I was seeing was some version of \"even if you disagree with me we can come together\" messaging.\n\nSo I was very much liking that. My wife and I went on a walk and were talking about things a couple weeks ago and we both agreed that we couldn't stomach voting for Trump again, and that we planned to vote for Biden.\n\nThen the last debate came around a few days later where Biden said in no uncertain terms that his administration would be looking at moving away from the oil industry.\n\nMy wife and I both work for an O&amp;G company. I can't vote for a guy who has made a statement that he's going to actively pursue cutting of my livelihood, especially when given what I know about how energy is produced, it would so incredibly damaging to our economy to even attempt, and the chances of success are so small unless you get into an incredible amount of government over-reach, but that's a conversation that is its own ball of worms that I would assume is a discussion no one wants to have.\n\nI read a lot of things that suggested that obviously Biden couldn't accomplish that, and that no one should really be worried he's going to kill the O&amp;G industry (even though he said he would), but it just signaled to me that he was saying something that he didn't even think. He was bowing to his left-leaning base, who are also responsible for the rhetoric I've been talking about, the identity politics, the critical race theory, etc. \n\nSo yeah when my wife and I saw that we realized it would be a mistake to vote for him. I don't know what she *actually* did obviously, but I voted for Trump.\n\nIronic that white men like me were the only 'identity group' that decreased our support for Trump, and that is likely the reason Biden won. biden campaign understand popularity minorities thought remotely surprising actually ready"}

No offense, I respect your opinions and anybody's opinions, but a lot of this can be described as mainstream garbage and/or contain a lot of tropes that turn people off of anime for being too weird/different.\n\nI would never seriously recommend No Game No Life to somebody not already into anime (just based on my tastes, I wouldn't ever, but depending on the person maybe). Nor Kyokou Suiri and Inu X Boku SS. Too echi, too much lowbrow humor. They are rather for people with very specific tastes.\n\nElfen Lied it's a pretty shallow horror series. Gore for the sake of gore, tragedy that poorly tries to aim for hitting emotional beats. Kind of similar to Made in Abyss, in that sense. Would leave most people with a bad impression of the medium, I think.\n\nAttack on Titan is great, but it's not a great adaptation. The manga would be a better experience.\n\nSteins;Gate is wonderful, as an adaptation is probably one of the best. But the VN is still significantly better. I would recommend the anime still, however, for people who want to experience the story in a much less time-consuming way. Visual novels aren't for everybody.\n\nClannad is a moeblob anime that, well, yes, it is an emotional experience, but not a earned one. I wouldn't describe any of the characters as well-developed.  People get emotional with the series because of the general sadness of the events, the excellent work of the voice actors and the soundtrack more than anything else. When I first watched it, I was ready to give it a 5/5 but, looking back on it, it was missing too many important things.\n\nCan't comment on Baccano, cause I haven't seen it.\n\nI second Onepunch-man and Lain.
